Beautiful day, great snow! I unintentionally Triggered a  small slab, There is no way to make me sound good on this one.

 

 

This  is skiers left of huge chute. I was second person in and triggered the slide.

 

my plan was to spoon partners tracks and not monkey around on walls.  Spooning his track on turn 2,  I noticed the windowpane breaking  above me.  I continued my cut left and headed for left wall.   

 

I was pretty sure the left wall I was heading for was going to go next,    Fortunately that wall held. I watched the slide go  by.

 

It was a small slab but  enough to  knock u down but not bury.  runout ok, but would have been a 300' ride ....

 

I noticed  Density changes in storm snow, on ridge  There was some very light wind effect on ridge. 

 

On the lap before (last shot skiiers furthest left in cirque that is normally quite narrow) I was able to intentionally trigger a very small Windslab/pocket (15'x10"") on a interface of a bench and chute restart.

 

Interestingly my buddy, who likes to go fast and not turn much, went first  and  triggered nothing other than sluffs on both laps.  We bagged our plans for cirque lap 3.

Temps were cold compared to the last few weeks. Winds were mostly calm and there was no sign of recent wind from the last 24 hours.

Did a little more investigating in their pit and found that the interface between the old snow from last weekend and new snow from latest storm cycle was still somewhat sensitive. ECTN11. Had to pull on my shovel a little to get the slab to move, but there was definitely a slab on top of a weak layer that pulled off cleanly. I dropped a medium sized cornice onto a lower angle section of the slope with only minor sluffing. Tying to convince myself to ski the slope, I dropped a cornice onto a steeper section of the slope which pulled out a storm slab that was about 40-50 feet wide.

Family in town for the weekend... I dropped them off at Brighton, hopped on Milly, and checked in with the local avalanche experts... AKA Brighton Ski Patrol :)

The crew informed me of a connected piece of snow in the backbowl that was worth looking at. I found a freshly triggered soft slab, low on the slope where grauple tends to pool. Averaging 12"" deep and about 75' wide there was just enough 4 finger hardness (yesterday's storm snow that got greenhoused and consolidated), allowing the slab to connect a bit wider than you might expect. Maybe big enough to knock you off your feet, but more of a wake up call is the need to manage all components of a steep descent, especially after you've nailed a big rad shot and have a low angle apron to cruise out on.... said lower angle terrain where grauple pools from steep slopes above, just might be the sleeper slope that could potentially catch you off guard.

Once down off the ridge, there was no wind effect and I opened up the first pitch of Doug's. I tucked into the trees before regrouping with my partner. The snow near the top of the line didn't have a crust, and we only experienced some minor sluffs within the new snow.

 

My partner then took the second section of the line, and this is where he intentionally set this off. Knowing that the snow changed and now experiencing a crust, it took him a couple ski cuts for it to break. It propagated more than he thought it would, see photo for connectivity.

 

It seems like the lower section of the line took a bit of cross-loading from the S/SW and that's why it didn't go on the initial roll over - he needed to be a bit more into the break to get some action. He exited stage left - sending off another pocket which was cross loaded as well. The slide ran down the remainder of the line and he watched it go from the high bushes and trees.

Our objective was to ski some fresh snow, and jump off some of the cliffs that Rocky Point offers. After a lap skiers right of the main cliff area, we skied through the skier's left cliff area. An initial ski cut, and run, produced no sluffing or snow movement. On our third run, I skied below and slightly off to the side of a cliff to shoot a photo of one of my partners jumping off of said cliff. None of us were expecting any snow movement in this particular area, as we had been ski cutting and skiing steeper slopes without any results. The slope we were on was not particularly steep, I would estimate it at 23 degrees, with a slightly steeper bit just below the cliff. My partner took to the air, and landed right at the bottom of the cliff in a pile of what must have been wind deposited snow, with a dusting of new snow on top. His impact broke through the slab 8'' down at the impact point, it propagated 15' on either side of him, with the crown tapering down to only an inch or two at the edges of it. I saw the slab break, and move toward me. I didn't have any time to get out of the way. The snow was moving slowly and shallowly. I stayed on my feet the entire time as it pushed me 150' or so down the slope. It was not deep enough to bury a person, and the moving debris only came up to the back of my knees at the deepest point. The slide itself was not particularly scary for these reasons. It was shallow, slow moving, and in inconsequential terrain. However, it still left me feeling shaken. We had been safe up until this point, and I got complacent with the conditions. The information that we had gathered up until then were positive indicators that we were making good decisions, and we let our guard down. None of us expected to set off a slide where we were, based on what we saw, and overlooked the fact that if something were to slide, it would be in the exact spot that it did. North aspect, wind loaded, at a rocky spot to release, and with a large trigger mechanism. In this case, a skier landing on the slope.

Early to mid afternoon I watched the lower portion of the S. ridge of Superior, a run known as Valerie's delaminate.  The low density snow from yesterday saw warm temps and direct sun for the first time and started peeling away with numerous natural point releases.  The largest one I saw looked to be about 60' wide and a few inches deep, entraining quite a bit of wet snow as it tumbled downhill.  While this slide alone would likely not be capable of a full burial I would suggest a few points:

 

-Wet debris can be very powerful, this could certainly knock a skier/rider off their feet and the ability to ski out of this while sliding downhill would be very difficult if possible at all.  

 

-Consequential terrain:  these types of slides in certain terrain can amplify the effects of even a small avalanches.  A small amount of wet snow is plenty to carry a skier/rider over a cliff or funnel and pile up in terrain traps.  (mid-low elevations couloirs*)

Comments:

 

To avoid canyon traffic, we agreed on Sunday morning a later start at the Maybird Couloir objective. Looking at the avalanche report, the weather forecast, and the Cardiff Peak wind rose, we were aware of the concerns of new snow and especially wind slab formation in  tight terrain. We were not terribly concerned with warming or solar influence.

 

We started up and noticed tracks (both up and down) in the couloir and began following the obvious skin track up. Along the first 1500ft of up the skin track was covered up periodically, which we had attributed to new snow skier sluff on the descent. Before the chock, as we were ascended we experienced one of two spindrift coming down off the climbers left side wall and minimized time close to the wall. The following ~900ft through the choke we booted as the skin track was hard to follow and this kept us to the climbers right and out of any potential spindrift exposure.

 

The skin track became evident again and we transitioned back to skins. Visibility was intermittent all day with fog and clouds rolling in and out through the up. As we started to skin, I made a mental note that we should be staying in line of sight and treat the up as the down as we had not brought radios. I saw and heard two more spindrifts, but there was no evidence that they were moving large enough to go into the skin track.

 

Another 250ft of vertical, in intermittent visibility, I heard my partner call out. I paused and looked down and saw him on his back. I called out if he was ok, but the wind prevented hearing a reply. A few moments later, the clouds let up and I could see him again, standing up. I asked if he was ok and got a positive reply. He looked well and didn't communicate any issues, so I continued up for another ~150ft.

 

I had lost sight of my partner again and so when on the far right, away from the ridge paused and waited. The wait extended, so I ate and drank. A few minutes later, I added layers to prevent getting cold. I called down now worried that I hadn't seen my partner in some time and he should have come up to me by now. I had not realized that 23 minutes had passed, I only discovered this after the fact looking at my gps track.

 

The clouds cleared and things quieted down and I called down again. This time he reported he had been knocked down and carried ~100ft by spindrift/new snow avalanche.

 

I immediately pulled skins and skied down to him, where he was on the climbers' right edge under a small (waist high) tree. When I got to him he explained that he thought that I wanted to push to the top since we were only ~700ft from topping out. I explained that I didn't understand he had been caught and carried, I thought he had just slipped and fallen in the skin track. We both agreed that radios would have helped and it was time to GTFO.

 

He packed up and as we were about to start our descent, having stood there for less than 3.5 minutes, I looked down and saw snow coming down across my skies, looked up to see another loose/new snow avalanche coming down, I braced my hips, hoping to remain upright, but the forces were too high as the moving snow was at least shin deep. I did not have time to put in my avalung mouthpiece.

 

I was caught and carried ~100ft. I laid on my back, kept my legs and arms wide for floatation. It took much force to pop my heel piece of my binding as I slide and my boot top put a significant amount of pressure on my calf causing a contusion.

 

I came a stop before the choke and the steeper part of the couloir. My partner came down to me, an despite some pain, we agreed it would be best to GTFO while we could still move and try to minimize our risk.

 

We skied down in pitches, moving off to skiers left when coming to a stop to avoid being entrained. I went first in case I had issues with my calf, my partner would be above able to assist, and we kept eyes above us for more moving snow.

 

We did not move or sluff any significant amount while skiing down or create any additional slides, even on the steeper pitches we were more concerned about.

 

We were able to make it down and reach the car without further incident. And while I had difficulty with walking, I was able to remove my ski boot pain-free.

 

Conclusions:

 

Things we did right: We planned well, we kept to our time schedule, we were aware of objective hazards, weather, and conditions. Observations on the way up indicated stable snow in the main couloir. We minimized exposure to spindrift and tried to stay as far right as possible to stay out from under it as well as spacing out to avoid both of us not getting caught at the same time.

 

Things we did wrong: We did not focus on the entire 360° snowpack concerns. We were focused on the snowpack under our feet and not looking and couldn't see up above. Not have radios. I do not thing that either of us will travel without them again. Having a easy way to communicate what had happened would have significantly impacted our outcome. Had I have known my partner had been swept down in a new snow avalanche, I would not have continued up. I would not have wasted 23 minutes waiting for him to join me. I would have been able to help him get his gear together and move us out of the couloir. A simple ""I was caught in a slide"" radio message would have dramatically changed my course of action. 

 

Bottom line:

 

We got lucky. We both got swept and carried in the safest part of the couloir. We were fortunate to not be carried into objective hazards in the chokes and neither were buried or had injuries that prevented self-rescue.

We read the avalanche forecasts for both the Provo and Skyline regions and checked the weather forecast beforehand. Our plan was to skin up Pole Canyon Road until we hit the drainage coming from Pole Canyon basin, go up the drainage to the basin, and pick a specific objective once we got to the bowl and could assess conditions. The main options we discussed were the NW Couloir, the Champagne Couloir, skiing just the bowl below the couloirs, or retreating from the base of the bowl if we did not like what we saw.

 

Below the base of the bowl (below 9400 ft) we observed 2-3 inches of fresh snow (mostly graupel) and little to no wind. We did note graupel pooling at the base of steeper slopes in the approach gully and discussed it as something to be aware of if a slab formed on top of it. When we got to the base of the bowl we experienced relatively poor visibility and NW winds at about 20 miles per hour. We also noted what appeared to be recent avalanche debris at the base and lower parts of the bowl. There was light to moderate snowfall, alternating between dense-moderately dense snow and graupel. Here the snow was getting blown around due to the lack of any shelter and the moderate winds. For the most part, the lower two thirds of the bowl consisted of about an inch of dense new snow on top of a firm but supportable base. Slope angles in the bowl ranged from the 20s at the bottom slowly steepening to around 30 degrees below the couloirs. We aimed to stay out of the main runout zone from the two most prominent couloirs, staying to the north and zig-zagging up the slope. As we got higher we began to come across more shallow windslabs and deep pools of graupel. We headed to the base of a rocky ridge separating two couloirs where we could discuss our options and perform more thorough snowpack stability assessments.

 

We dug a pit (WNW facing, 10,200 feet, 30 degree slopes angle) and conducted an ECT. We got an ECT18 on a density change 20 cm down and an ECT28 above a very firm pencil hard crust 75 cm below the surface, although neither failures propagated and the shears were not clean (of note is the very deep snowpack in the area we dug. My 300cm probe did not reach the ground. Our pit was 150cm deep and my probe still did not reach the ground starting from the base of the pit. HS is greater than 450cm in the area we dug.) We discussed our test results, our observations of windslabs and the lack of visibilty and lack of knowledge of what was going on above us in the couloirs. We decided not to ski any of the couloirs due to these factors but to venture a little bit higher and continue to assess the snowpack as we went. Here we were traveling across slopes in the low 30s in steepness with much steeper terrain in the couloirs above. We crossed slopes one at a time, keeping within view of each other and moving from safe zone to safe zone (our safe zones were the areas right below rocky ridges that separated the couloirs. We continued to note shallow windslabs, most not more than an inch or two thick. 

 

We reached the ridge separating the Champagne Couloir and the NW couloir. I began making my way across the slope. I dug a shallow hand pit and isolated a column with my ski pole. A simple hand shear test revealed that the windslab was not well bonded to the snow below. At this point I made up my mind that I did not want to go much higher, as the terrain quickly got steeper with elevation and the windslabs seemed to be growing slightly thicker. I made up my mind to keep going to next island of safety, wait there for my partner, and discuss skiing back down the slope and not going any higher.

 

I crested a shallow ridge of snow and shortly afterwards was swept off my feet as the snow I was traveling over let loose. It all happened very quickly and I am unsure as to whether I triggered a windslab avalanche or if I was it by a windslab or loose snow avalanche from the couloir above. I was carried on my side with my skis facing sideways in a controlled manner. I screamed avalanche at the top of my lungs multiple times to alert my partner since visibility was not great, although he reported that he could both see and hear me. While I fought to stay in position and tried to self arrest on the bed surface the slope angle soon moderated and I began to slow down. Luckily I did not suffer any injuries and did not lose any gear. When I came to a stop I got up, traversed out of the runout path from the NW couloir and yelled to my partner that I was okay and for him to ski down to me. I would estimate that I reached a max speed between 20 and 30 mph. The avalanche was shallow and I was never pulled under the snow. The runout was also clean with no rocks or trees to hit. My partner and I estimate that I was carried between 200 and 300 vertical feet before coming to a stop.

 

With lots of overhead hazard we quickly skied down to the base of the bowl and then through the trees down to the road and back to the car. Below are my thoughts on the incident, as well as some relevant photos I attached.

 

Things we did wrong:

 

Terrain choice and lack of respect for overhead hazards. The relatively low winds and relatively low recent snowfall totals lured us into thinking that we could safely tour in some more committing high elevation areas on Nebo. Traversing under those couloirs was not a good idea given the past snowfall, moderate winds, and current moderate snowfall rates. It would have been much smarter to choose to ski in less high consequence terrain in areas where we could more easily assess the snowpack.

 

Lack of attention to aspect: Right before I either triggered or got hit by the avalanche I crested a shallow ridge of snow before entering the main runout from the NW Couloir. In retrospect I realized that the slope aspect shifted from NW to NNE. It makes sense that the slope was more wind-loaded than ones we had previously been traveling on due to the dominant westerly winds.

 

False assumptions/human factor: After seeing that much of the new snowfall fell as graupel and noting the deep pools below the couloirs I had mentioned to my partner that it I thought it was likely that not much of the new snow had stuck in the couloirs and may have used that assumption to justify travelling beneath them. Additionally, ski conditions were excellent and although I tried to keep it from being a major factor that may have played into my decision to push it a little bit higher and gain a bit more vertical of skiing.

 

Things we did right:

 

We took constant assessments of the snowpack and discussed them extensively. I think communication between my partner and me was good for the most part.

 

We did acknowledge that we were traveling across consequential terrain and thus moved one at a time across the suspect slopes. My partner had eyes on me and was ready to spring into action had he lost sight of me or if I had been buried.

 

I am grateful to be unharmed after this experience and hope that my report is helpful.

It was a roof avy. We were skiing all day at Brian Head, occurred at the cabin we are staying in. Really wasn’t thinking this would happen. I just wanted to share it because we had just come back from skiing, had just taken our gear inside when it happened. Would have been much worse if someone was by the vehicles! The vehicles were buried at the deepest point, over 6’. Would have been much worse if someone had been unloading gear. Would not have wanted to dig a person out of that debris. Really brings home how serious it is.  Just to show the power behind this, my truck's windshield was smashed and there was snow inside the cab.

Before teaching Brighton Backcountry 101 this afternoon, I decided to do a bit of class prep and look around to see what's going on in the Brighton Basin. Fresh snow and sustained southwest winds steered me towards a cross-loaded slope to confirm suspicions. Standing on a lower angle portion of the slope (island of safety) I took off my skins, shifted my weight slightly, slid a ski tip into a fat portion of the drift in front of me and was able to trigger this fresh drift that was surprisingly tender and connected. Avy failed on a preserved layer of near surface facets.

Judging by the lack of new or wind blown snow on the bed surface it likely happen sometime late last night or early this morning from the increased SW wind. It is located on a NE aspect at 10,300' at the upper reaches of Mill Fork of Chalk Creek. 
","","","When zoomed in you can clearly see the missing piece of cornice and the depth of the slab. This slide is another repeater which last ran late January. It looks to have once again failed on the upper most layer of depth hoar that was not cleaned out during previous slides. This continues to be a theme with many of the large events in the Uintas this winter. Each event is failing at a deeply buried, relatively strong layer of facets but not eliminating them. Much weak snow remains in the bed surface and the combination of advanced facets and thin snowpack continues to provide the recipe for big delayed action avalanches. It has been over one week since the last significant new load to the pack and we are still seeing big slides initiated by big triggers."

Despite my warning about being too close to the edge, my partner walked over a section that was not obviously overhanging. As he walked past, a ~15ft long chunk of cornice broke free, taking some footprints with it. Fortunately, he was still on the ridge. The cornice took some snow down with it. Not sure if it was a wind slab, or just loose dry snow. Terrain features prevented any sort of propagation if it was a slab , and it was confined to the gully.  

 

Despite the debris looking like they weren't big enough to completely bury a person, the consequences of falling off with the cornice were still quite high. A 15-20 foot fall onto exposed rocks and the subsequent tumble down a couple hundred feet is certainly enough to cause season-ending injuries at least. Even though this was in an easily accessible and heavily traveled area, rescue would have been quite difficult and time consuming and would expose others to risk unnecessarily- our party would not have been able to safely extricate a patient without outside assistance. 

 

Attached photo is  looking down the gully where the cornice fell. The pole is marking a left footprint... the matching right footprint is on top of one of the blocks a couple hundred feet down the slope. 

 

 

Please, stay back from the edge! Even farther than you think. Try to keep vegetation and/or rocks between you and the ridge line so you are certain that you are walking on a ridge, and not on an overhang. This cornice surprised an experienced backcountry traveler, and it could surprise you too.

We were a bit suspicious and proceeded carefully.

 

First and second skiers skied down with no issues. 3rd skier triggered a small wind slab pocket that propagated about 50' wide and ran about 100' long. Slow moving snow allowed skier to get out to safety easily (great reflex, he traversed and hid behind a tree). The small debris pile was not deep enough to burry a person but could have knocked you down easily.

 

We also skied West and East facing slopes through the day and did not encounter any other similar wind slabs. Just light fluffy dry powder everywhere else.

 

This was a small isolated pocket but I wonder how widespread the SW wind loading is out there.

If this had been loaded with more snow and had ran on a bigger slope it could have been a more serious slide.

I will treat NE wind loaded slopes and gullies as suspect, especially with the new storm snow forecasted in the next 2 days that will cover them and make them harder to detect...

These cracks are a result of the sheer weight of the cornices in the windward side of the ridge, pulling north away from the rest of the snowpack. They are 6” to 1’ wide and run all the way to the ground. We observed them in several places along the ridge, running about 30’ long, and ranging from 10’ to 25’ back from the actual edge of the cornice. They reminded me of glide cracks. They were covered by fragile snow bridges made from wind drifted snow in several places, which was easily removed with brushing from a ski pole or ski.  My takeaway is to remain WAY further back from the edge of the cornice than one might think. I have no idea how much extra weight the sheering chunk of snow can support, but I think that falling with one of these bus sized pieces of snow would mean death.

","","","This avalanche is interesting because it was most likely triggered by elk.  Many elk tracks have been seen in the starting zones of the avalanche paths near The Forks of the Huntington.  Also, there was no other significant weather event at the time of the avalanche.  No recent new snow load, no heavy snowfall, no significant wind, no rapidly warming temperatures or sun, no rain. 

The snowpack structure also supports the likelihood that this was elk triggered.  I was in Huntington Canyon the previous day and identified the poor snowpack structure with layers of faceted snow buried deep in the snowpack.  While doing fieldwork, my partner and I experienced a number of ""collapses"" of the snowpack where it made a loud ""whoomping"" noise underfoot.  This is to be expected with buried faceted snow.  We also had test results where the weak layers were failing easily.  The lower slide paths in the canyon near Blue Cut down into Avalanche Alley are holding even weaker snow than is shown in the video below."

We got up to the top of SM around 9 AM and didn't see any tracks or slide activity so we continued up to WM. We had blue skies and winds of around 25 MPH with a lot of fresh graupally snow being transported into deposit zones. Once on West Monitor, we decided to check out the stability of the cornice and the stability of the wind slab that had clearly formed. We had no intention of skiing it, we were just curious. On a safer zone of the cornice, my partner walked out to about 6 feet from the edge, where he kicked and I held his pole. We weren't going to get any closer than what we thought was a pretty safe distance (6 feet and not appearing to overhang). After two or three kicks, the section of cornice three feet ahead of him caved away, triggering the whole bowl directly underneath the cornice. We had time to get to the edge and watch as it pulled away the slope below as well as propagate South under a shelf that was down 50 feet or so from the initial crown. The debris field and cloud were huge and continued well into the flats below. 

 

We weren't sure exactly how to access the crown to do an analysis since there was a lot of hangfire left that also seemed relatively unstable, but I carefully poked down underneath it just to get another perspective of the slide and hopefully identify the weak layers as well as get some measurements on the depth and snowpack. I didn't feel totally safe in the position that I was in and a large chunk of cornice still hung half-broken and precariously perched above the path. I measured the depth in that spot, 135cm (one pole) but it wasn't a fair representation of the whole slope which I would say averaged closer to 30-45cm. The slide's bed surface was also very hard - so hard I struggled to get my edge in. That was really all I felt comfortable looking at before wanting to get out from under the cornice and remaining slab.

From a historic perspective this area claimed the lives of two snowmobilers on March 10, 2001.

 

 

Saturday February 9th, 2019-

Jason joined Shannon and his son Jessie for a day of riding in the Chalk Creek drainage. They planned on sticking with low angle terrain and meadow riding. Shannon and Jason wore avalanche beacons, Jessie did not. On their way out of the area they decided to play on a slightly steeper slope, about a mile south of Humpy Peak. Both Jason and Shannon took turns climbing the slope which was connected to steeper terrain above. After his third climb, Shannon and his son Jessie posted up on a relatively flat bench feature and watched Jason climb slightly higher than the previous attempts. Shannon watched Jason climb towards the uphill side of a dead tree low on the slope, and was alarmed when he noticed Jason's weight shift to the downhill side of his sled, like he was getting knocked off his snowmobile. Shannon looked up at the ridge above and witnessed the steep chutes beginning to avalanche. He tried to keep and eye on Jason, but was also worried about his sons safety and attempted to get his attention and alert him of the situation. As Shannon realized the enormity of the avalanche, both he and Jessie throttled their machines and headed to the west out of the slides path.

 

Once the dust settled Shannon rode to the last seen point, jumped off his sled, and began a beacon search. He had difficulty switching his F1 beacon to ""receive"", so he powered down the unit, and then reactivated it, but may have erroneously engaged his beacon to ""send"" mode. There was some signal confusion and Shannon thought his batteries were dead so he quickly changed batteries and continued his search. At some point Shannon realized the enormity of the situation and activated his SPOT locater. He searched the debris pile, zigzagging below the last seen point and keyed into the first signal about 15 minutes after beginning his search. Shannon didn't have a probe, but he and Jessie began digging where Shannon heard the strongest signal. They dug but didn't see any clues and began trenching to what they thought was a likely burial area.  As they were digging a group of two snowmobilers arrived. They had probes and shovels, but no beacons. They began probing and within a few minutes one of the probes struck Jason and they began digging him out. Jason wasn't breathing when the group extricated him and Shannon began CPR for approx. 30 minutes before a DPS helicopter arrived on the site.

13:20- Summit SAR activated  

13:34- DPS Pilot notified  

14:15- Approx time Jason is dug out of snow and CPR begins

14:28- DPS Crew in Star 9 launch

15:00- Jason on board aircraft with heli enroute to Evanston Hospital  

15:14- Landed at Evanston Hospital 

15:18-  Doctors called the time of death due to traumatic injury.


 



Burial details-

Jason was carried approx 100 feet vertical but 380 feet slope distance.

He was buried at 40.85772 -111.01588, elevation 9900 feet, 

He was 15 ft directly uphill of the buried sled

 ","Historically weak, shallow, and dangerous the Uinta snowpack often resembles the structure and strength of a Continental, rather than an Intermountain snowpack. It's not unusual for the western Uinta's to develop a sugary, basal layer near the ground that never heals and remains problematic or persistent for the entire season. As a matter of fact, it's more the rule than the exception. However, the winter of 2018-19 has been slightly different, characterized by a more consistent storm track, delivering more storms and denser snow with higher water content, or SWE. Avalanche forecasters measure snowfall in terms of inches and feet of snow, but more importantly the snow water equivalent (SWE). In other words, it's how much water the snow contains. If you melted the snow, how many of inches of water would it be. From an avalanche perspective, we don't care how much snow fell. We care how much weight was added to the snowpack. More weight = more stress. The more you stress something, the more likely it will break. When the snowpack is stressed and breaks, it produces avalanches. A rough guide is that 1 inch of SWE is about 10-12 inches of snow.

 

OCTOBER/NOVEMBER-

Late October snow helped set the tone and the building blocks of our winter snowpack, but consistent snow didn't begin to stack up in earnest until Thanksgiving when a cold, robust storm system delivered two feet of snow with 2"" of H2O or SWE. Another 10"" of snow with an inch of H2O rounded out the month.

 

DECEMBER-

Unfortunately, the pattern became inconsistent and weak storms along with strong winds became the dominant theme of the December weather pattern. As a result, the snowpack remained relatively shallow and grew weak, producing faceted, sugary snow both at the surface and near the ground. A small Christmas storm did little to turn the tide and the end of the year was punctuated with an unusually strong East-Northeast wind event that created a hard, dense slab which formed on top of the pre-existing weak surface snow.

 

JANUARY-

On January 7th, a warm, wet, and windy storm slammed into the region delivering 18"" of snow with nearly 1.5"" of SWE, and very strong west-southwest winds. A thick, dense layer of snow grew on top of the New Years wind slab. Most avalanche activity could be characterized as ""pockety"", but one large avalanche breaking to the ground (pictured below) in upper Weber Canyon made me realize the potential this disastrous layering could deliver. In addition, our snowpoack sturcture suggested a sketchy setup as illustrated in a nearby snowpit profile (pictured below)



 



 

 

January 18th brings yet another round of dense, heavy snow. 18"" with 2.25"" SWE along with very strong southerly winds clobber the range and an Avalanche Warning ensues. This storm is the tipping point, bringing the snowpack to a critical threshold and avalanches begin failing near the midpack New Years slab and then quickly break to the ground where the snowpack remains thin and weak. This snow, water, and wind event also leads to a string of human triggered avalanches in the western Uinta's and a number of close calls, but fortunately no accidents. However, the writing is on the wall and one thing is clear... each time the snowpack receives a substantial amount of SWE, the pack comes to life and avalanches conditions light up.

 



 



These snowmobile triggered slides triggered in late January, accurately represent the depth, width, and magnitude of the type of avalanche conditions inherent with the snowpack for the western Uinta Mountains.  

 

February-

A very wet, warm, windy storm materializes on the evening of the 2nd, delivering 2"" of dense, heavy snow, along with southerly winds blowing in the 30's and 40's. An additional 18"" of snow along with 2"" of SWE stacks up on the 3rd with continued strong ridgetop winds. South and southeast winds blow in the 50's and 60's through the 4th. An additional 4"" of snow with .50 SWE stacks up in the early morning hours of the 6th and southerly winds continue to blow in the 40's. The storm finally winds down on the 8th with storm totals delivering a whopping 38"" of snow and 3.4"" of SWE.... a colossal amount of snow, water, and sustained winds.

 

FEBRUARY 9TH 

WEATHER DAY OF ACCIDENT-

The morning starts of with a layer of high, thin clouds and a few snow flurries. And while snowfall tapers off, southerly winds continue howling along the ridges, transporting snow onto mid and upper elevation, leeward terrain, especially slopes facing the north half of the compass. We are in-between storms and by mid afternoon the winds increase slight and it begins snowing. Weather didn't necessarily play a role the day of the accident,  it was actually the weeks worth of weather beforehand, but it definitely complicated the logistics of the rescue. Had it been later in the day, chances are the DPS helicopter would have had a difficult time assisting in the recovery efforts.

2- Know the number of guys you are with because thinking of all the names of the guys in your group is seriously hard when you are wondering if one of them is buried!

3- radios are a tool I never thought I’d use in an avalanche situation

4- i will admit to this! Keeping your composure and staying calm in that situation is near impossible! I lost it!

2 other skiers and I had made 3 pervious descents off Pioneer Ridge (Skiers left of Corner 3, V Tree, Corner 4). We had ski cut previous start zones while only observing surface sluff running. Our 4th run of the day at 2:15PM was Skier’s right of “Toilet Bowl.” We descended off Pioneer Ridge and staged in trees around a short chute above a bowl which opened to skier’s right of the chute. One of my partners ski cut the middle part of this chute. We observed surface sluffing which we allowed to run full track (300 feet?) thru the bowl. I had discussed putting in a second lower ski cut to trees below my partner now on the left side of the chute. Based on our 3 previous runs of similar aspect and pitch I opted to drop in without the second ski cut. I allowed the possible false negatives of our previous lines to cloud my judgment, in hindsight.

I made two turns, the second of which brought me out of the chute and into the apron/bowl which opened up to my right. My partner on the left observed the avalanche and shouted as I saw the initial flank fractures/failures below me in the fall line to my left. The slide propagated around and above me for 80-100 feet total, the bulk of it to my left was estimated to be a foot deep. I attempted to ski to and self-arrest on a stand of trees to my left. I made it and was able to get a hand onto them. I felt moving snow pulling the back of my skis downslope and was unable to maintain my grip on the tree. I attempted to deploy my airbag following losing my grip on the tree at the top. Mittens (I usually wear gloves), snow, and the violent thrashing prevented me from deploying the bag. I alternated between attempts to deploy it and fighting like hell to swim to the surface. I was carried 600-700 feet before I stopped. Avalanche debris continued past me and ran for about 900 feet total from the crown. 

Both partners report initially seeing the slide and my attempting to self-arrest on the tree. I was flushed through a stand of trees 200-300 feet below them where they lost visual contact. I was able to establish verbal contact with them prior to their descent. My guardian angel must have sat on my shoulder and cloaked me in comfort, because I arrived unscathed, head up, on-top of the pack 10 feet above a large pine trees with disturbingly deep pile of avalanche debris at its base. They reported that the bed surface was “hard” and “extremely slick.” They described it as nearly impossible to turn on.

A few thoughts in writing this:

1) I had identified a possible second ski cut as an option but decided against it based on previously observed stability. We had skied similar pitches that day, but this was more open then everything other than V-tree. I allowed my previous runs of the day to lull me into a false sense of security, which is a classic thinking heuristics error. This ski-cut might have triggered the slide and placed me onto an island of safety. My only cost would have been giving up 2 turns, and potentially sluffing more snow down the slope. That is a cost I should be willing to pay each and every time.

 2) I was unable to deploy my airbag. I should have done so while attempted to reach the trees. This was the last time I was upright and unencumbered by the violence of the avalanche. I am fortunate in this case that deploying the bag was unnecessary to prevent burial. Still it might have righted me and oriented me head up during the slide.

3) I am a very experienced backcountry skier, as is the partner who placed the ski cut. I have 12 years of backcountry travel experience, and Avalanche 1 and 2 certifications. The ski-cutter probably has double that experience. My 3rd partner has a few years experience and Ava 1. I offer this statement in an acknowledgement that if this kind of event can happen to us it can easily happen to other riders. Brighton's backcountry gets heavy traffic, but can be a very dangerous place. I took solace that such a terrifying experience was happening while I was skiing with trusted, knowledgeable, and experienced partners.

At the end of the day they parked under a bowl just north of the peak when they triggered an avalanche on the east facing part of the bowl. It was their first day of riding on this trip in this area. One member of the group has a cabin nearby. They had ridden in the area at least two times previously this winter. Once before Christmas and another time in mid January. Their plan was to finish riding in the area near the accident site then return to the cabin to meet another person. They had not seen any avalanches. They had no formal avalanche training.


When the avalanche happened:

Shad (rider 1) was further southeast and was not caught
	Brad (rider 2) attempted to ride southeast but was caught and fully buried (1-2 feet deep). He was 10-15 feet downhill of his snowmobile which was fully buried.
	Todd (rider 3) was caught and partially buried. Only his fingers were sticking out of the snow. However, it was just enough for him to begin slowly dig himself out of the debris. He was 40 feet uphill of his snowmobile which was partially buried.
None had avalanche rescue gear. Riders 1 and 3 searched for about 30 minutes but could not find rider 2. They called 911 at 5 p.m. Some SAR members approached the area that night but could not safely enter the area due to darkness and avalanche hazard.

On Friday, Feb 8th, SAR personnel resumed the search and rescue operations. Scene safety was assessed from the air via the DPS helicopter. Then the helicopter crew performed a RECCO search in hopes that the RECCO detector might get a signal return from some metallic object or electronic device on either the victim or his snowmobile. They detected some signal and marked that location. Next, they flew 2 blasters to the top of Circleville Mountain with explosives. These two people triggered a hard slab of wind drifted snow and deployed explosives in a few other areas.

Meanwhile ground crews were waiting in a staging area. Once the scene was safe, the two blasters with one person from the ground crew located the victim's fully buried snowmobile using the approximate location from DPS, a hand held RECCO device and probe poles. Rider 1 had provided a last seen point for Rider 2. The last seen point and the location of the snowmobile narrowed the search area considerably. WBR had 4 dog teams ready to search. The first dog team was delivered to the top of Circleville Mtn at 11:02 a.m. The dog and his handler descended to the avalanche debris and located the victim at 11:11 a.m.

A landing zone was established about 40 feet from the victim's location. The victim was transported via helicopter.

SAR personnel unburied the two snomobiles. Both were driven out of the area.


This accident occurred in Beaver County on the Fishlake National Forest.

Rider 2's full burial location: 38.20043 -112.40307, elevation: 10,920 feet
	Rider 2's buried snowmobile (15 feet directly uphill): 38.20043 -112.40308, elevation: 10,920 feet
	Rider 3's partial burial location: 38.20091 -112.40313, elevation: 10,890 feet
	Rider 3's partially buried snowmobile (40 feet directly downhill): 38.20102 -112.40311, elevation: 10,880 feet

Below is an account of the accident from Rider 3. We sincerely appreciate his willingness to share this information so that we all may learn and become safer riders.




I figured there would be plenty people that would like to hear the story, so I'm writing it down before it gets covered with emotions and other stress.  I don’t know that I’ll ever forget it, but maybe small details.

Around 5 pm on Feb 7,2019, Brad, Shad, and I went up to prep Brad's cabin (up Beaver Canyon) for a little couples weekend trip/birthday time.  One of Brads favorite things to do was snowmobile, and it was always a good time going with him. We went early to spend the day riding before our wives came up that next morning. There was a recent storm that dropped 34”+ or so, which made the snow super fun and very deep.

We had decided at the end of our ride to run up a canyon to just look at this big bowl/basin at the bottom of Circleville Mountain. Quite a ride in the thick snow off the main trail. None of us planned to try and go up the big chute, but I've watched Brad and Shad try a couple times in previous years. Shad led the group up the canyon and veared off thru the trees towards the east opening. Brad went straight and I followed him. I couldn’t see where Shad had stopped, but I stopped about 50 yards into the trees shy of Brad (which was right at the base of the hill in the open).  Only stopping for a moment, I looked up and saw an avalanche coming quickly towards us. I yelled to Brad and finally got his attention. He looked back and quickly tried to ride away from the avalanche.  There was nothing I could do..

Within a split second it was almost on top of me, and something told me to stand on my snowmobile and jump straight up.  Split seconds later I was hit by a semi-truck and the force was so powerful it ripped my helmet off, then instantly engulfed me.  The weight and the force was painful.  As I was being covered something told me to reach my hand as high in the air that I could, and at that very same moment - I was buried! Now it was dark.  It was disturbingly quiet. The pressure was intense - more than I’ve ever felt. I started to hyperventilate and couldn’t really breath. I couldn’t move, and I remember saying aloud, “I am NOT going to die here today, pull yourself together Todd!”

Then, I could feel it... My right arm was raised still and I could feel the cold outside air with my fingers. (The force of the avalanche has also ripped off my right glove).

For the next 5 minutes I wiggled my fingers to make a hole, then I could wiggle my hand, then I could start digging to my wrist, then I could slowly move my arm.  Finally fresh air and more light came, and though I was still stuck, I could see light and breath - that was all that mattered.   My left side of my body was in bad shape. I couldn’t dig, and it was hard to move due to the pain.

With one arm, I worked the next 10 minutes or so at unburying myself from head to waist, then all I could do was scream......It was quiet... No answers....  I yelled again, then I could hear Shad's voice off in the distance. But not Brad's... I pulled my phone out and saw I had 1 bar of service with 5% battery, so I dialed 911.  They were able to ping my location and said they’d get help on the way.  The sun was starting to set. Minutes later Shad ended up finding me and crawled to help me move to a position to lay down to help with the pain.

Frantically we yelled for Brad. Shad searched, but couldn’t go far from me due to the conditions. We were stuck, and completely hopeless. In pain, cold, and unable to help our friend... Over the next couple hrs we waited up there. Shad made a few more phone calls to Nicole and Brad's Dad.  We also talked again with 911 and Search and Rescue told us to get out of there. 

Painfully and eventually we made it down the mountain, and to the hospital.  It was about 830pm





The first photo below shows the avalanche triggered by explosives in the red circle. Terrain to the left of the photo was blasted but did not produce additional avalanches.

The second photo below shows the approximate locations where riders 2 & 3 were buried. Rider 1 was positioned outside the frame of the photo in the direction of the red arrow.","This avalanche occurred on an east facing slope on Circleville Moutain. The top of Circleville Mountain is flat. This is significant because it provides a large area (or fetch) for winds to grab snow and redeposit it on the slope that avalanched. The avalanche was approximately 1000 feet wide. It broke 3-10 feet deep. The non wind-loaded portion of the crown was 3 feet. Most other areas of the crown face were heavily wind loaded and much larger.

The alpha angle was 23 degrees.","This area is outside regular forecast zones, and we have limited snow and avalanche information. The Utah Avalanche Center publishes observations from the public for this area. Precipitation and wind data were collected from the Big Flat SNOTEL and Beaver 15E. Both are about 7 miles NNE of the accident site at at elevations of 10,349 feet and 10,007 feet respectively. Graphs of wind and precip data are included below.","While riding into the scene on snowmobiles, we noticed widespread cracking and collapsing of the snowpack, a sign of unstable snow, along the road on small slopes both above and below the road. The photo below shows an example of one. The cracks appeared to be at least a day old.

 
","Below are photos of the full burial site of the victim, his buried snowmobile, the location of the partially buried person and his sled.","This search and recovery was performed by Beaver County SAR, Piute County SAR, Sevier County SAR, Wasatch County SAR, Utah Department of Public Safety (DPS), Wasatch Backcountry Rescue (WBR) with professional ski patrollers from Park City, Brighton and Snowbird, Forest Service Law Enforcement Officers, Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center (UAC), and Utah Division of Natural Resources.","The first photo below shows the north end of the avalanche.

It looked to be between two and three feet deep at the crown but it appeared to have stepped down close to the ground. I'd guess the slide either failed at the new snow/old snow interface or, more likely, on the persistent weak layer that formed at the beginning of January, and then stepped down to older snow. Parts of the flanks were 5 feet deep and snow was piled up 6 to 8 feet deep on th uphill side of the trees. The most impressive aspect was the distance the slide ran.

Red Flags

-Cornicing

-Wind Loading + Rounding

 

Today my tour partner and I set out to head up Patsy Marley’s west facing ridge line. We got up the initial foothill onto the ridge, but soon after finishing our switchbacks we observed major cornicing and rounding.

 

We had decided not to travel the ridge any farther and just ski a couple of shorter runs off the beginning of the ridge line. We had seen another group who also skied the same zone. Upon getting up to the ridge for our third run I saw a skier’s track continue past where we had gone. I then looked up and saw a soft snow slab slide on the leeward side of a cornice, which was triggered by a skier dropping in here. We saw the skier’s tracks exiting.

 

We were dropping in at about 27 degrees, and this slope was a bit steeper, but I do not want to guess at a degree as I did not feel comfortable traveling near these cornices to get a closer look. I would guess this slab was about 10-12” of soft snow.

 

We did observe a pit today which did not have any layers stand out in our density test, but we did not do any compression tests. Overall I was amazed with the cornicing and rounding that occurred on Patsy Marley ridge from this past storm. We believed the ridge line would be difficult to navigate safely with the current cornicing and wind loading.

I kept a float but was unable to escape, air bag deployed and was able to self arrest  on a small tree after being carried about 150 ft. The avalanche continued on down the run without much propagation until near 9,700 ft. where it dropped down as a hard slab avalanche (estimated 2 to 3 ft crown).

 

FORECASTER COMMENTS: 

 

I just got off the phone with Curtis who was caught in the wind slab in Cold Fusion. Couple bullet points:

 




	They have all taken a level one class or greater.
	All members of the group read the Provo forecast. Even though they live in SLC.
	As they were climbing up the line, they noted how the snow was changing and they didn't like it so they stopped 500' from the summit.
	They all knew the storm was coming and they wanted to sneak in a big line before the danger increased and limited objectives.
	They all communicated well and decided it was too dangerous to reach the summit.
	They skied one at a time and slope cut the upper reaches of the line.
	It was the 3rd person to slope cut the line that triggered the wind slab.
	It was very scary for the person caught as they had the choice to fight to the left or right of the line. They made the choice to fight for the skiers left and it turned out to be a good decision as the main debris flowed to the right. They don't think they would of made it out before it triggered the secondary slide.
	The skier was able to deploy their airbag easily, one they noticed they were being caught and carried.
	Everyone in the group was carrying beacon, shovel, probe and some with airbags.




 

The wind slab that was triggered was about 1' deep and unknown how wide. The debris traveled roughly 600' down slope before triggering a secondary avalanche that was 2-3' deep and 60-80' wide. The secondary avalanche was much larger and traveled much faster. it was easily deep enough to bury a person. This avalanche stopped a few hundred feet above the summer road. See pic for details.

 

In hindsight - they felt the avalanche forecast was spot on. They all talked about the decision that was made and felt it was a good objective for the day.  My feedback was that the forecast was for major winds out of the SW and that line would load under those conditions. Heating and warm temps may have played a role but up to the point of the avalanche many of the classic red flags were missing. 

 

The group did ski one at a time from safe point to safe point and tried to minimize their exposure to avalanches.

There has been no significant weather in the last few days to cause natural avalanches.  There are hill climbing sled tracks visible adjacent to the avalanche.  There are also sled tracks that have been covered up by the avalanche debris.  All of these factors indicate this was a sled triggered avalanche. 

This slope is one of the usual suspects and it is not out of the ordinary to see avalanches like this here.

The slope is east northeast facing and is very prone to getting loaded by wind drifted snow from the west.  It is also the correct aspect and elevation to hold old buried weak sugary snow that formed in mid December.  This ""faceted"" snow from mid December is what all of the bigger avalanches have been failing on over the last three weeks.

At approximately 4:00 p.m. one member of the party (rider 1) climbed to a steep, high pass with an easterly aspect at 11,974’, between Mount Mellenthin and a sub peak of Laurel Mountain. Three other members of the party followed with riders 2, 3 veering off to the looker's left, while rider 4 took a straight line up a narrow gully. Two snowbikers (riders 5, 6) were lower to the left, under a group of trees beneath the SE face of Laurel Mountain. Riders 7, 8 were riding beneath a small knoll out of sight of the rest of the group.

Rider 1 reported feeling a collapse as he looked down from the pass, and he saw the slab fail and propagate outward onto the entire NE face of adjacent Laurel Mountain. Rider 4, who was headed up the gully, took the force of the avalanche head on from approximately 600' below where the slide had initiated. Riders 2, 3 reported last seeing him in the avalanche at approximately 11,350’. Riders 2, 3 rode out to safety on the looker’s left side.

When the avalanche stopped, the party regrouped near the toe of the debris, did a head count, and realized that rider 4 was missing. Members of the party attempted a search. Between them they had 3 beacons, two shovels, and one probe. They believed rider 4 was wearing a beacon, and reported hearing a “ping.” They uncovered a snowmobile near the toe of the debris, and located a helmet, but not the victim. Rider 5 left the scene to call 911, and San Juan County dispatched a Classic Air Medical helicopter, but as darkness was falling, further search and rescue efforts were suspended until the following morning.



Photo illustrates the position of party members at the time of the avalanche.

Coordination efforts between San Juan and Grand counties, and the USFS Utah Avalanche Center began around 6:00 p.m. with the San Juan County Sheriff’s Office in command.  Plans for search and rescue efforts the following day included an aerial reconnaissance to determine scene safety, and contingency plans for avalanche mitigation, and professional avalanche rescue dogs and handlers from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, with support from the Utah Department of Public Safety.





At 7:00 a.m. on January 26, a reconnaissance flight determined that avalanche mitigation work would be required to render the scene safe for search operations. While waiting for the arrival of the bombardier team, a DPS helicopter flew over the debris with a RECCO unit and a Long Range Receiver (LRR). A RECCO unit is a specialized search device for people with a RECCO reflecting chip built into their clothing. The LRR detects signals from avalanche beacons. They reported a signal from the LRR near the last point scene and dropped a flag. Avalanche mitigation work produced one very large avalanche but the debris did not over run the original avalanche debris. This work was completed at 2:35 p.m. and dog teams were inserted near the last point scene at 3:10 p.m. A beacon search was performed with one of four searchers receiving an erratic signal. A dog alert near the signal prompted a probe search of the area. Meanwhile, the other dog and handler continued down the debris. At 4:20 p.m. the second dog alerted near the toe of the debris, and at 4:35 a positive probe strike was made. The body was recovered about 150 feet uphill of the victim’s snowmobile. He was buried 2-3 feet deep. He was not wearing a beacon, but had one turned off in his pack.

Located on the east side of the La Sal Mountains, upper Dark Canyon is a high alpine cirque surrounded by the prominent peaks of mounts Mellenthin, Laurel, and Peale. The area is remote and generally visited only by snowmobilers. Like most alpine areas in the La Sals, upper Dark Canyon is comprised of steep, open, avalanche terrain, punctuated with cliff bands and steep convexities. The slope that avalanched extended from a southeast facing saddle below the southwest ridge of Mount Mellenthin, up to the summit of northeast facing Laurel Mountain.

Season Synopsis

Early October storms brought 2’-3’ of snow to the La Sal Mountains above 10,000’. Snow remained into winter on E-N-NW aspects. A melt freeze crust of varying thickness developed with facets underneath. At lower elevations, melt freeze snow, or moistened and refrozen facets made up the entire base layer.

Conditions then remained dry until two storms between November 30, and December 2, brought up to 30” of snow. Most of December was dry, and the snow settled and faceted to the point that it was possible to trigger loose avalanches down to the October melt freeze crust later in the month.

Over Christmas, 6-8” of snow fell accompanied by moderate to strong SW winds. Natural avalanche activity occurred during this period, both as loose snow sluffs, and as wind slabs failing on the faceted interface above the October crust. This kicked off an active weather pattern with regular storms, and a cumulative Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) over the next 30 days totaling 5.7”. Avalanche conditions throughout the period were very sensitive with widespread collapsing, shooting cracks, and frequent natural avalanches. Two Avalanche Warnings were issued, and a major cycle occurred on January 18. Natural avalanches also occurred on January 16, 21, and 24.

Snowpack

The snowpack can be broken down into three major events – October snow at the base of the pack, early December snow as a faceted weak layer, and storms since December 26, forming a cohesive slab 3’-4’ deep on top.

Weather history the week of the accident

By Wednesday, January 18, three-day storm totals equaled 18” of snow at 1.75” SWE. This produced a wide spread natural cycle on E-N-W aspects. On January 20-21, 14” of snow fell with 1.2” of SWE producing more natural avalanche activity. January 21-25 brought on a windy period with moderate to strong west to northwest winds 



Season snowfall in Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)



SWE for past 34 days leading up to the accident.



Winds for past three days leading up to the accident. 
","The La Sal Mountain avalanche forecast for the day rated the danger as Considerable, with human triggered avalanches involving wind drifted snow, and buried persistent weak layers likely on steep slopes facing NW-N-E, on mid and upper elevation terrain. Travel advice recommended sticking to wind sheltered, low angle terrain and meadows. 

We aim to learn from accidents like this and in no way intend to point fingers at victims.  All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center have had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes including forgetting to turn on our avalanche beacon. 

Please carry appropriate rescue gear - beacon, shovel, probe, and know how to use it. 

Check the avalanche forecast and choose terrain appropriate for conditions. 

Keep track of your partners, and only expose one person to danger at a time. 

We would like to thank all of those involved in the search and recovery effort including San Juan and Grand County Search and Rescues, Classic Air Medical and the Utah Department of Public Safety, Snowbird, Wasatch Powder Bird Guides, and professional dog teams from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, Alta, and Park City ski patrols.

It's also worth noting that we observed several other natural releases on similar aspects and elevations in the Exxon's Folley and Gravel Pit Lanes areas.  The skier's left side of the Funnel is also loaded up with a visibly thick wind slab that looks very touchy.  Although Corkscrew is a tempting area in all of the new snow, I would steer clear until the snowpack has had plenty of time to settle and no additional loading.

Unfortunately I do not have a good zoom lens that could capture an adequate photo of the slides, but if you look over toward Corkscrew on your drive up Geyser Pass road, you will see the crowns.

What little cornice there was above the middle chute wouldn't budge no matter how hard I stomped near the ridge. However, it was clear that there the slope would fracture with wind slabs (the snow was perfectly toned from the wind). Did a quick ski cut and skied out of the chute to watch half the chute turn into a river of slough, maybe 16"" deep (shown from below and above in the pics), which ran all the way to the base of the chute. It took off the top of the settled storm snow and left a mildly crusty base underneath. The narrower chute to the skier's left (the highest chute, right off the peak) would almost certainly be a full-on river of slough, with nowhere to go to get out of its way.

The ridge at the top of Yellow Jacket sported strong westerly winds and lot of fresh cornice growth. We didn't touch them on our first lap, as poor visibility prevented us from seeing the whole run out zone. On our second lap, around 3pm, visibility improved and we were able to be certain that no one was below us. We were able to stomp off a number of fresh microwave-sized cornices. A few triggered small wind pockets, but only one caused a notable avalanche. It started as a small wind pocket also, about 15' wide and 6-10"" deep. As this one slid down slope it entrained more snow, and by the bottom of the slope appeared to be 40-50' wide and ~12"" deep. It ran about 400 vertical feet to the bottom of the bowl. I'd call it D-1.5, not big enough to bury someone but enough to take you for a wild ride. The improved visibility allowed us to notice 2 similar-sized debris piles also in Depth Hoar Bowl, likely natural cornice-triggered. Wind loaded terrain seemed touchy, non-wind loaded slopes showed no sign of instability.

Also saw some other wet slides on the south end of timp off of the cliffs (second photo). Similar wet slides also observed on the south end of Cascade (SW facing aspects) earlier this weekend.

Deciding to keep it safe, we worked one at a time along the traverse and down into the trees just above Easter Bowl. At around 8700', I made a turn exactly where Jon and Joel had skied through and broke the small wind slab free shown in the photo. Fortunately, the slab did not slide far, and we were all unharmed. The terrain was roughly 30-35 degrees. We continued cautiously down the lowest angle terrain possible and notified a ski patroller of the incident. 

 

The lesson here is that just because you are in a resort does not mean that you should let your guard down. Taos should be a prime example of this. There were more than a few solo riders traveling through this avalanche terrain today. And to make matters worse, we were all stuck inside a ping pong ball of a cloud with extremely flat light and limited visibility. Know the terrain you're skiing in and choose good partners both in and out of bounds. Be safe out there! 

 

Forecaster note:  some great points here - it's always good to have a partner, and keep them in sight, even at a resort.  Though the slide wasn't large enough to harm someone, reporting it to the patrol was the right thing to do.  And it's a really good example of how an increase in wind speed or change in wind direction can change the avalanche danger almost instantly.  And yes, I too, wear my beacon and carry rescue gear most days I'm at a resort.

Emery and Sanpete County search and rescue arrived at the scene around 8pm. Inability to assess avalanche danger on adjacent slopes, mainly due to darkness, did not allow the rescue teams to get onto the debris. A helicopter searched from the air with spot lights. At midnight the decision was made to regroup Saturday morning and continue the search. 

On Saturday, January 19 the search resumed under the command of Emery County Sheriff's Office. Explosives were used to make the scene safe and ensure more avalanches would not occur. People were staged near the avalanche debris in anticipation of performing a probe line. Searchers on skis started at the top of the debris field using a RECCO device and an avalanche search dog. The search dog located the approximate location of the victim which was confirmed with and avalanche probe at approximately noon on January 19. The victim was buried a maximum of a meter deep and was found in a prone position facing downhill.

More information and photos has been posted by the Emery County Sheriff's Office HERE.

 

Location of crown where skier tracks enter: 39.63333 -111.25038, elevation 9520

Burial location: 39.63400 -111.24742, elevation 9,080

Toe of debris: elevation 8,900 ft (approx.)

While the vertical drop was about 600 feet, the slope distance this avalanche ran was 1,500 feet.","The Electric Lake bowls sit just south of state highway 264 and just west of Electric Lake proper.  The bowls are easily reached from the parking lot and are some of the more accessible terrain for skiers on the Skyline.  The accident took place on a steep northeast facing slope at 9500'. 

Aspect ranges from due east to northeast.

There were many undulations in the bed surface. Many of these were caused by large rocks. It was notable while walking on the bed surface how ""rolly"" it was with many partially covered rocks. These can often serve as good trigger points where the snowpack is a bit shallower. A few of these rocks can been seen in the second photo below. ","We measure snowfall in terms of the snow water equivalent (SWE). In other words, its how much water the snow contains. If you melted the snow, how many of inches of water would it be. From an avalanche perspective, we don't care how much snow fell. We care how much weight was added to the snowpack. More weight = more stress. The more you stress something, the more likely it will break. When the snowpack is stressed and breaks, it produces avalanches. A rough guide is that 1 inch of SWE is about 10-12 inches of snow.
Snowfall history can be broken down into three periods:

Some snow fell in October which remained on upper elevation north facing slopes but the the snowpack started forming in most places around November 21 through December 3 when snow containing 6.7 inches of water accumulated and formed the base of the snowpack. 
	Some snow fell between December 3 and December 22 with more significant storms around Christmas and New Years. More importantly during this time, there was a notable dry period. This clear, cold weather created weak, faceted snow (aka - sugar snow) near the surface. The weak layer which this avalanche fractured into was formed between Dec 13 and Dec 22.
	Significant snowfall returned on January 6 when a 2 day storm delivered 15 inches of snow containing 1.6 inches of water. The next period of snow occurred from January 15 and ended just a few hours before this accident occurred. Snow from this storm was 12 inches containing 1.4 inches of water. These were manual snow measurements from a snow study plot very near the Electric Lake dam which is 3 miles SSE of the accident.  Data from Mammoth Cottonwood Snotel (5 miles NE of accident) is also provided in a chart below.  Snow from these two storms was clearly evident in the crown face of this avalanche. In photos below you can see two distinct layers that made up the slab.
Trees surrounding this accident site were still covered with snow at the time of the accident indicating minimal wind. However, this slope may have been loaded by strong southwest winds that wrapped around this slope and cross loaded it during a period of very strong winds late on the night of Jan 17. At that time winds averaged 40-50 mph with gusts of 50-60 mph. Much of the avalanche activity occurring in this area prior to January 15 happened on wind loaded slopes. An avalanche in Rolfson Canyon was a good example.

 
","The Skyline Area Mountains avalanche forecast for January 18, 2019 stated: ""Conditions are still dangerous but not as bad as if we'd received the forecast amount of snow. The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE today. Human triggered avalanches are likely on the upper elevation steep slopes. Any slope with recent deposits of wind drifted snow should be avoided.""  

Since January 7th, and before the accident, the Skyline avalanche reports included 12 slab avalanches, averaging 2' deep and 200' wide.  Nine of the twelve involved faceted snow layers.  A 'heat map' of the activity is found below, depicting the pattern of the avalanche activity on an aspect/elevation diagram.

We aim to learn from accidents like this and in no way intend to point fingers at victims.  All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center have had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes.  No one is immune to this.

Here are a few things we can learn:

This is the third avalanche fatality this winter in the United States where the victim was not wearing an avalanche transceiver.  Your chances for surviving an avalanche burial are greatly increased if you wear an avalanche transceiver.

It is important to always keep an eye on your partner when they are descending avalanche terrain.  This way you are quickly aware of an avalanche if one releases.  If you are watching your partner when they are caught in an avalanche you have a better chance of knowing where to start your rescue effort which ultimately saves time.  Time is crucial as statistics show - the greatest success of live recoveries happens within about 15 minutes of burial.

The part of the slope where these skier descended seemed fairly benign compared to the rest of the slope. It was 31 degrees in steepness where they started their descent. There was a short rollover that reached 37 degrees. Our perceptions of hazard can vary a lot, but the most important terrain factor for avalanches is slope angle.


This search and recovery was performed by Emery County Sheriff's Office and SAR, Sanpete County Sheriff's Office and SAR, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Division of Natural Resources, Utah Department of Transportation, Alta Ski Patrol, Forest Service LEO's, and the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center.

The couloir to the flats is 4000ft and it ran that and likely another 500ft through the meadows by. I would not be surprised if we can find flattened trees down at the bottom later this year. The tail end of it likely blew by the hope campground or it may have even spilled up into it a bit. I am assuming that no one was in that slide path or in the run out on a day like today with the heightened avalanche risk.

Lots of propagating on steep angle slopes along the road. Typically, just the movement of the snowmobile on the road would create a slide or propogation cracks on steep slopes along side the road.; the sled didn't need to be on the slope. All the avalanches went to the ground, were isolated embankments, and were in sheltered areas. The hazard I see is snowmobilers staying on low angle terrain, but riding in terrain traps. Gullies, embankments, short steep slopes can easily slide and cause a partial buriel.

Descending the upper wooded headwall there was predictable sluffing, the main shot in the bowl skied normally. I opted for a WNW facing steeper exit to the gentle aspen glade below, without thinking much of it honestly. I ski cut it as always, expecting perhaps a somewhat longer-running sluff, and was a bit surprised to trigger a small soft slab avalanche. It began in the narrow choke immediately below my skis and propagated somewhat enthusiastically out on both sides as it went down, running all the way to the aspens below. It wasn't very deep, maybe 6"" at most, and wouldn't have been enough to do any harm in the terrain I was in, but it did run probably 200' vertically, until the terrain reduced in angle quite a bit. I obviously hadn't ascended this route so I didn't get a great look at the snow conditions before it went, it seemed like just the new snow, but hard to say it wasn't wind loaded too, as the wind was changing directions all morning. I descended the bedsurface and took some pictures, sorry for the poor quality, visibility was quite poor at this time (~8am), it was snowing steadily and there was a fair bit of wind. Having ski cut this exact shot many times this season with no more result than light sluffing I was a bit surprised to be honest, particularly at this aspect/elevation.

I found widespread sensitivity in the new snow on leeward terrain features, and I remotely triggered numerous very soft slabs to the east of the shoulder, out on the face, as I climbed through the trees and over all the little wind drifts that grow along the upper shoulder. These slabs were between 6 to 12 inches deep, but they would mostly""eat themselves up"" immediately after releasing. Where the slabs were deeper, as in the attached photo, the weak layer was just above the melt freeze crust from Monday 1.14. Elsewhere, there are sensitive density inversions within this morning's ~12"".  

Generally I think this avalanche problem is manageable in most terrain. However, as of 10 AM, it's still snowing pretty hard in upper LCC, winds are still transporting snow, and if temps continue to warm, I think this avalanche problem will become less manageable. 

Note: leaving Alta last night at 7:30 PM, rain or freezing rain was falling at ~8700', on top of the very light density snow that had fallen earlier in the day. It would be interesting to see if there's a thin rain crust out there an inch up from Monday's snow surface.

I triggered it with a snowbike. I was trying to ride up through the trees on the north west side but followed others toward the north face (north east). I saw someone stuck in a tree on that north east face so I turned around to help. When I wrapped around a tree my bike washed out from underneath me and tipped over up hill. I stood back up to see the slide happen from the bottom of my snowbike. Fortunately the tree above me kept any snow from sliding above me. The snow depth was probably 16 inches.

A very experienced avy forecasting team remotely triggered the avalanche in the images above while descending a lower angle, adjacent slope. Breaking 2'-4' deep and 400' wide, this slide was initiated from a distance, on an upper elevation southeast facing slope, broke to weak snow near the ground, and stacked up a tremendous amount of debris in the gully of the runout.

 

Now here's the curious as well as the spooky thing about this incident.... this is the 6th notable slide triggered on a southeast aspect which is quite unusual given the fact that we generally steer towards the sunny terrain when we're dealing with persistent weaknesses in the snowpack. However, a common theme we're seeing is this... nearly every big slide triggered since the New Years snow and wind event has had an easterly component to its aspect.

We noted a couple of small avalanches.  The most notable was a pile of debris in one of the Camp Chutes.  Visibility was poor so it was difficult to make out where it started.  We could make out fractures low in the path but the debris pile seemed too large (note decent size dead tree in the debris also) to be just from the lower section of the path.
","Unfortunately, the basal layers of the snowpack in Huntington Canyon have fallen apart due to it's shallow nature combined with the mid December dry spell.  Basically, all of the snow prior to the Christmas Storms has turned into loose faceted sugary snow grains.  Of note, the majority of the recreational terrain along the main portion of the Skyline has a much deeper and stronger snowpack without this type of weak snow near the ground.

Below is a photo of a snowpit from a north facing slope just above the dam.","I was able to remotely trigger the test slope above the snow study plot.  It was hard to determine whether the weak layer was the VERY loose facets at the ground or just the new lower density snow under the higher density wind blown snow.  It could've been either.  The bottom line is that the snowpack is not supportable here anymore and skis basically punch through well into the facets now.

The apron appeared mostly wind scoured with a few pockets of pillow-type wind loading. Decided to follow the skin track and reassess as we went. About 100ft up recognized a 3-4 inch, hard wind slab on specific aspects. The slab was receiving quite a bit of loading as we made our way up. About 1/3 of the way up the apron I punched in a step and noted some tectonic-like pieces of hard slab cracking around me. The whole pocket then released about 40 feet above me. I was able to stay on my feet and anchored skis/poles into the bed surface. Fortunately, I was not carried or buried.

 

Had we been in extreme terrain or with anything dangerous below us this could have had consequences. Our conversation before ascending the apron recognized the active wind loading and pockety hard slabs forming in the apron. We decided it was manageable because of the safe run out and generally shallow wind slab. We were traveling one at a time across the slope so my partner was spared the slab deluge. 

 

A couple more thoughts about decision making: We saw a party on top of the peak flying a drone. There were also ski tracks littering the slope. This may have given us more courage as we proceeded.

We were skinning up to East fork from Cardiff and we're noticing more wind loading than expected. We were skinning across a lower angle bench with a steeper roll below it, when the leader noticed he had skinned onto a bit of a slab and turned around to say we should spread out. At that point the second triggered a collapse with slight cracking around him, and noticed the avalanche running on the steeper roll below. No other parties in the area and we were all safe above the roll.

 

It appeared to be a medium to hard wind slab which formed overnight, because the skintrack was covered. In places the slab was probably 1-2 feet thick and the crown varied between about 1 ft and a couple inches. Crown was probably 200ft wide. Bed surface was 35 degrees. It was remote triggered from approximately 100ft away. It ran out maybe halfway to the valley, running through trees with quite a bit of force, but not breaking them.

Party of two was ascending terrain adjacent to Blue Ice run in Broads Fork of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Partner A was 60-70' above Partner B as they recognized fresh wind-loading and decided to spread out on the skin track. Partner A triggered the wind slab, and went for the full ride of the avalanche - an estimated 300'. Partner A had lost their skis, and was partially buried, having to use their shovel to extricate themselves from the debris. Partner A then walked up the debris searching for Partner B. At an estimated 100' below the crown of the avalanche (200' above where Partner A began their search), Partner A found Partner B's ski which was still attached to Partner B. At the time Partner B was unconscious and was partially buried. Partner A was able to isolate an airway and determined partner B was breathing, but still unconscious. Partner B was unconscious for an estimated 30 minutes, before they regained consciousness. Partner A and B then began a self rescue back to the Broads Fork trailhead, with the assistance of a party on an adjacent slope. Despite not having Partner A's skis for travel, the team made it back to the trailhead and to the emergency room at the hospital.

Fortunately, this accident had a much better outcome than what could have happened. Partner A and B's ability to self-rescue, given the loss of gear and long period of being unconscious, is remarkable. Thank you for sharing this information with the Utah Avalanche Center. We will amend this report with any additional information we receive.

It had a 2' crown, was ~30' wide, and only ran for ~10'. The slope angle at the crown on top of the gully was 35deg. The crown on the lookers left side of the gully may have been a slightly steeper slope angle. Two out of  three members were skinning up the slope at the time the avalanche occurred and were carried, but not buried. One ski came off but was found. One pole was lost. One member sustained a minor ankle sprain but was able to ski out without issue. The third member was out of the way at the bottom of the slope.

 

Some details about how this occurred:

 

The plan for the day was to go to Hogum. Once in Maybird Gulch, we noticed a lot of cross loading and a couple of recent avalanches on the east facing slopes from Hogum Hogback (Picture 4). We decided to abandon that plan and explore some of the small runs in Maybird Gulch that were less wind loaded so we could stay out of the wind loaded, consequential terrain. After discussing this, we ran into a gentleman who had triggered the avalanche in one of the east facing chutes over Maybird Gulch that we were looking at which further confirmed our decision. He was booting up and over the Hogum Hogback ridge to get to the needle when the wind slab broke out. He lost both of his poles and was shaken, but okay to ski out. The picture of that avalanche is in picture 4 below.

 

After a couple of runs, we were hiking across the main gully of Maybird Gulch over to Maybird Aprons. There was a small mini gully that we had to climb up. It was cross loaded, but was only about 30' tall and had a flat run out.

 

The first member of our party was skinning up the choke (near the rocks in picture 2, near the person in picture 1) when the wind slab broke out above him and carried him down the slope about 10'. One of his skis came off which was found, he lost a pole, he inflated his airbag, and has a minor sprained ankle. I was waiting towards the side of the feature (where I thought I would be safe) and was also carried down about 10' from the flank. I am uninjured and didn't lose any gear. The third member of our party was at the bottom of the slope in a safe area.

 

The pictures don't show the run out, but it flattens out at the bottom of the pictures which is why the avalanche didn't travel very far. It was a good learning experience as although we knew this small feature was wind loaded, I don't think any of us were expecting a 2' deep hard slab to break out. As the pictures show, the whole gully including the steep lookers left side broke out and funneled down to the flat section below about 10'.

We then decided to end our day as the wind slab problem seemed widespread. I should add that on the way to Small Pass we crossed paths with a guy that had triggered a larger wind slab on an east facing slope close to where we were later that day.

In between the 1st and 2nd pitch there was a layer of thin ice with a 4” layer of faceted snow and a 2-3” layer of ice on top of that. This layering was observed for about half of the snow slope in between the lower and middle aprons of ice.  It was about 20’ wide and 40’ long. Their was a ominous whumpf right before it slid that happened just as I stepped onto it thinking it was solid ice. I was carried down a few feet before I was able to catch myself with my tools while the rest of the snow and ice slid past. I had one mediocre screw in place that possibly would have caught the fall, if not it would have been a big whipper.

Thankfully there were 2 pitons to bail off nearby since I noticed other slopes had the same layering characteristic on the intended route.

Fortunately the belay location was under overhanging rock and protected from the debris.

I took pictures of the piton anchor in case anyone else finds they want to bail off them instead of crossing the same way. It would be tricky to find a place for a V thread or other bail option in that area so once you’re in it you’re committed.

It was a close call!

On our way up to Cardiff Pass this morning we noticed two small point release avalanches below the cliff bands directly east of Cardiff Pass. It seemed that they likely occurred sometime late in the day on Thursday.

Later in the day when our party returned back over Cardiff Pass we noted that there was an additional, larger slide that occurred on the same slope just a few hundred yards to the East. This slide was much larger in size and seemed resemble a wet slab more than than a wet loose avalanche. We did not formally measure the size of the track, crown and debris pile, but I would guess the slide to be 4-7” deep, 20 feet wide, and running for 250 vertical feet. I did not notice any sign of a skier or snowboarder triggering the slide, and it seems likely that it was triggered naturally.

The photos below show the smaller slides that we observed in the morning and then a close up of the larger avalanche that must have occurred sometime today between 9:30am and 3:00pm.

I was standing near the stream about to cross the stream at the bottom of the Mill D South Fork drainage when I heard the avalanche.  I turned around and observed a large volume of loose avalanche debris cascading off a cliff face below Reed and Benson ridge.  I was surprised by the volume and duration of the falling debris, it just kept coming (probably close to 10 seconds).   By the time I had ascertained my partner was safe and I pulled out the phone to take a picture the debris was nearly done falling over the cliff.

 

I suspect that somewhere in the rocks and the sunbaked snow field above a release happened, picked up steam and carried a large volume of snow over the cliff in the attached picture.  From our perspective we couldn't see anything to ascertain depth width or where the debris ended up.  The caution about the danger of warming snow in the forecast that morning was right on.

Additional Detail: A party of 4 skiers on AT gear approached Red Baldy from White Pine Fork.  On the final approach to Red Baldy's west ridge and on the west ridge itself, the party kicked off a few 2-6 inch wind slabs, all of which broke at the skinners' feet and were manageable.  After a few ski cuts, the party skied Ice Fall without incident.  The party was breaking trail most of the day, including the skin out to East Pass.  About 200 feet before reaching the pass, the 1st skier in the party kicked off a wind slab slide.  The crown of the slide varied from 4-15 inches deep and was about 10 feet above the 1st skier.  The 1st skier was caught and carried about 10 feet before self-arresting on the bed surface, fully above the snow.  The slide was 15 feet wide at the starting zone and propagated around a small band of rocks, reaching a max width of about 45 feet.  The 4th and last skier on the skin track, who was about 35 feet below the trail breaker, was hit by the slide.  The slide caught and carried the 4th skier 25-30 feet.  When the 4th skier came to a stop, the moving snow washed over him and left him buried with the exception of his hand, which was moving above the snow.  The 3rd skier on the skin track had a visual of the buried skier, immediately slid down to him, and uncovered his face.  No beacon search or probing were required.  The buried skier's face was about 18 inches below the snow surface and his skis were about 3-4 feet below the snow surface.  The skier's face was buried for 30-60 seconds.  His partners extracted him without injury or lost gear.  The party then found a safer route to East Pass and returned to White Pine Trailhead. 

 

The party identified a handful of mistakes that were made.  First, they underestimated the danger of wind slabs.  Everything they'd observed before the slide was only a few inches deep and did not pack a punch, which made the party feel that the wind slabs were manageable.  Immediately before triggering the slide, the first skier on the skin track mentioned that the snow was getting more slabby/punchy.  Rather than reassessing the route or waiting for the remaining members of the party to skin to safe locations, the 1st skier started skinning up to a small ridge, which he thought would put the party in a safe zone.  The rollover on the ridge is where the slide started.  Looking back, the party should have stopped and communicated before proceeding.  The slope that slid was cross-loaded, and safer snow could have been found by kicking back in the other direction.  The starting zone was one of the steepest and most wind loaded areas of the slope.  The party did not measure the slope of the starting zone, but estimate it to be 35-40 degrees.  

 

With the possibility of wind slab, the skiers feel they should not have been skinning above one another. All 4 skiers could had noticed this was occurring and could have raised the issue, rather than deferring to the trail breaker.

 

The buried skier attempted to deploy his avalanche bag, but the bag did not deploy.  Afterwards, the bag was tested and still did not deploy, with no defects being immediately apparent.  The airbag had not been tested at the beginning of the season.

Hairy Christmas!

Headed to PC Ridge for some turns in South Monitor. After skiing a laps in the skier's left part of the bowl without incident (an area without October snow) I decided to push a little farther skier's right where I knew a slide had occurred on 12/15. Winds this past week had refilled this area forming a cohesive hard slab under about 6"" of fluff. Stomped it quite a bit and even dropped a fair size cornice chunk on it before dropping in. Hit the ""sweet spot"" as the slope window paned two turns into my run. It broke out approximately 30' wide at the crown, fanned out to about 70' and ran 2/3rds of the slope. A repeater, it failed on rotten October snow on the ground. Manageable skiing off of the slab but it could have gone much differently. 

So far this season, I’ve been safely skiing areas without October snow or by paying attention to slope angles. Broke both those personal rules and added skiing a slope that is a known repeater. Discussed the line with my partner and called it a “well calculated risk”. Knowing if it went, there was an escape skiers left to an area with no October snow provided enough confidence to take the risk. Rewinding thought process in my head later, the decision was a poor one. Comparing the area skied to the slide there 12/15, this slide easily could have broken out wider. Although not deep enough to bury, it could have been a rough ride. 

Honestly, the lure of a favorite fun line on good snow in a clouded my better judgment. This area hasn't been able to build up a strong snowpack to put that October sugar on the ground to rest. I knew this and yet...

In general, there was about 4-6"" of new, light density snow in this area, which was prone to sluffing on steeper slopes, but otherwise stable (no cracking/collapsing) on mid to lower angle slopes.  The bed surface was a VERY hard layer of sun baked snow 20-25cm down which was so firm and icy that it was hard to even skin through.  The new snow itself wasn't so much of a problem as it was light density and fairly shallow, but the wind loaded areas (southish facing) were 2-3 times that deep and had set up into a firmer, more cohesive slab.  The bond between the new snow and the icy bed surface is moderate (ECT test = 11) right now, but I think it will strengthen quickly on south facing slopes over the next few days if conditions remain the same.

There were several tracks throughout Days Draw, including adjacent to the slope that avalanched.

Obvious red flag warnings (cracking, collapsing, abundant and variable wind loading) had us on high alert and making conservative choices. The remotely triggered slide broke 10 feet underneath the cornice and ridge and ran 100 feet where, surprisingly, it was stopped by a group of trees. We didn't venture out for photos nor to measure the crown, but the wind slab looked to be around 18-20 inches deep.

 

The second slide was on a ESE aspect in UFO 2 around 9300 feet elevation. Sluffing storm snow broke a soft slab (4-6"" deep) out that propagated to 50 feet wide, and ran 400 feet. The slide occured in new snow that had fallen on top of an unbreakable sun crust.

 

In summary, we found considerable danger today on high ridge lines, where wind slabs are variably distributed and seemed to be quite sensitive. If we get additional storm snow, or additional wind loading we would expect the danger to remain and increase in the next few days.

","Early October snowfall and subsequent high pressure set the stage.  The October snow, experiencing significant temperature gradient metamorphism, quickly devolved into loose, weak, sugary, faceted snow.  By mid-November, we had a good potential bed surface in the way of crusts....good weak layers in the form of weak faceted snow.....all we needed were storms to build a slab to make avalanches.  An active weather pattern began on Thanksgiving (November 22) through December 4th adding 61"" of snow (5.14"" snow-water-equivalent).  (Snow and water numbers from Alta ski area.  The Porter Fork area typically has 50-75% of this snow.)  This, combined with periods of stronger winds, led to unstable avalanche conditions with a High or Considerable avalanche danger for suspect terrain through Dec 8th.

The crown was on a 32 to 33 degree slope which roles over and gets steeper down lower on the slope. The crown averaged around 2ft but was 3ft in the middle. It measured between 450 to 500ft taking all the snow out to the ground. I did a crown profile which revealed light density snow on top with the slab getting stiffer moving down through the pack. It failed on facets on the October crust then stepped down to the facets below the crust at the ground interface, taking the crust with it.

The avalanche depth ranged from a couple feet to over 6' and failed on facets above a crust formed back in October.

We then had 1 more join us midday and with visibility getting poor, we decided to go seek shelter in the low angle trees on powerline ridge in cardiff fork of BCC. To get to that area you must cross a section of steep NE facing terrain around 10500ft. We discussed our plan and felt that we could manage our terrain there by staying very high on the avalanche path and practicing safe travel protocols across the slope. We have all visited the area a lot over the course of every winter and chose an alternate route across the slope to minimize our exposure. We understood that the area was thin and rocky and on the leeward side with the recent wind direction and we would very likely trigger an avalanche there but being high on the avalanche path and in downhill ski mode we felt as we could manage that terrain. The first person went across the slope and got to the ridge. The second skier on slope got to the ridge and when he did he hit the sweet spot and collapsed the slope. The avalanche propagated behind him and up the slope 20 ft and  across the slope 40ft. The avalanche ran 150ft or so and was size D1. SS-A-S-R2-D1-O

It is important to note that although I put this avalanche as unintentionally triggered we did expect this result to happen but understood that we would be high on the path with speed to get to the ridge and only 1 person exposed at a time. Our intention was not to trigger the avalanche but to scoot across high on the slope to get to the low angle terrain that we would be safely skiing for the remainder of the day. No one caught or carried. 

As the first skier stepped over the ridge in a safe, low angle area out of harms way he remotely triggered an avalanche behind him 30 ft up the slope that failed on facets around the rocks and propagated 40-50ft across. Needless to say it was very touchy out there especially on the leeward side of slopes where dense snow and heavy winds were overloading and quickly stressing the PWL's near the ground. Lots of collapsing noted in low angle north facing terrain.

Our ascent route back up to the ridge was across the bed surface and then we boot packed up loose rocks and facets to avoid being exposed to the avalanche danger where the normal skin track goes. ","","",""

My partner and I left Alta around 1 PM for a short tour for exercise and a quick snowpack eval.  Graupel was falling, accumulating anywhere from 0 to perhaps 8 cm deep, with variations due to wind transport.  A stout, 1 cm, rain crust existed above about 9200 feet that was extremely slick.  We skinned up low-angle terrain beneath Toledo Bowl. 

At about 9500 feet (thumbnail F above), we decided not to go higher into steeper terrain and to return to Alta.  As my partner descended the slope just to skiers left (east) of the pucker trees, a slough broke out on a slope that we measured later at 20 degrees.  The slough continued down slope and I shouted to my partner who skied right into the pucker trees as the slough continued its slow march downslope, eventually descending into Toledo Gully.

We continued slowly working our way downhill, encountering a solo skier who eventually skied ahead of us and encountered a debris pile where Toledo Gully crosses the jeep road and traditional skin track to Cardiff Pass.  The solo skier told us he witnessed no other skiers in the vicinity, but he skied ahead of us and wisely did a beacon search where there was a debris pile at the skin/track jeep trail, finding no signals.  We then caught up to him, had a quick discussion, and the solo skier went down perhaps 100 vertical feet further to the toe and did another search, again finding no signals.  My partner and I repeated both searches just to be sure, then returned to Alta and reported the slide to UDOT.

Photos below illustrate the remarkably low angle nature of the starting zone of this slide and how it ultimately descended into and down Toledo Gulch.  My partner is near the toe of the slide in the final photo, with a debris pile more than deep enough to bury someone.  A stout rain crust served as an extremely slick bed will likely be a problem tomorrow as well.  Typical practice of keeping slope angles under 30 degrees may not be sufficient in areas where this graupel on rain crust exists.","","",""

Partnership management became an issue because getting hit from above was a real threat. The bed surface was hard, shiny ice and sliding for life was a secondary threat. Riding conditions were actually fast and fun on slopes less than about 10 deg in steepness but everything else was hard and slick but at least smooth. I'd call the danger considerable and very unlike anything we normally see.  High likelihood (virtual certainty) with low consequences that could quickly get out of hand on a long open steep slope with terrain hazards.  Snowing hard when we left.

","","","Forecaster Comment: Below here we are copying and pasting in the words of UDOT forecaster John Woodruff. "" Here is a quick write up of what we are seeing in the Provo area mtns.  Last weeks rapid warm up in temps had kicked the free flowing water into high gear for the start of the spring run off even at the upper elevations on everything but the upper  N1/2 of the compass.  Low elevation snow that still remains has gone isothermal, and the mid elevation snow is gradually moving that direction.  Upper elevation snow is still a mix of damp round DH, crusts, fine grain damp rounds, large wet rounds, and slush.

Problem #1 -  This is the trickiest and easiest to overlook, but the persistent slab problem from the week layer that sits anywhere from 4cm to 20cm below the the Feb 18th dirt layer is still reactive.  Pit tests on Cascade and Timp have both confirmed this with Compression tests yielding results ranging from CT23SP, CT25SP, to CT23SC in the past 2-8 days.  This week layer is slowly turning into a deep slab problem as it joins the large wet rounding DH sitting on the bottom 20cm-35cm of the snow pack.  All of this water percolating down is going to make these full depth releases a greater possibility.   

Problem #2 - Wet Slab activity will be increasing as this water pools above MF and rain crusts still intact with in the snow pack.  Attached is a picture of a pit at 9900', ESE, 41deg slope on the east side of Timp.  HS-90cm with wet saturated snow down to 76cm and water percolating through damp fine grained rounds and ponding just above the crust at 50cm in the snow.  (The dirt layer sits at 33cm for reference).  Until the water develops some reliable runnels and escapes through the rain/MF crusts these will form nice bed surfaces for these wet avalanches to start, and then step down to the ground once their weight overwhelms the weak damp basil layers.  

Problem #3 - Wind slabs (most likely to encounter).  We have noted  isolated wind slabs at mid elevations to large widespread uniform wind slabs at upper elevations that formed on the 27th-28th of Feb.  They are gaining strength, however you can still pry them out. 

We noted 4 separate avalanches on the upper elevations of Timp yesterday (April 1).  All were on NE faces around 11000'.  All 4 avalanches likely occurred on Wed the 28th from strong SW winds transporting snow onto the NE faces.  We observed isolated wind slab formations in Primrose Cirque on the 28th that were easily triggered by a skier.  

The first was on the Emerald Lake Headwall (Timp Glacier) a HS-NC-R2D3-O.  800' wide by 3'-5' deep.  11200' down to 10600' (600' vertical foot fall). 

Second was below the summit shack on the NE face. HS-NC-R1D2 (wind slab).  60' wide by 2' deep.  11200' down to 10400' (800' vertical foot fall.  Mostly due to steepness of area)

Third was off the Timp Basin Ridge just north of the summer trail.  HS-NC-R2D3-O.  500' wide by 6'-9' deep.  11000' down to 10800' (300' vertical foot fall) 

Fourth was the largest. Thanks to the pictures from Turly we were able to determine that the entire slope to the north of the natural ax that he photographed including wrapping into Stairmaster bowl had avalanched.  11200' down to possibly 8500' (2700' vertical foot fall with a substantial debris pile) 

The snow pack in the Hidden Lake Basin is around 145cm-270cm deep with the Feb 18th dirt layer at 70cm.  Most of the snow depth in the Southern Wasatch has come after  Feb 18th which means that we have a still reactive buried weak layer sitting on top of large moist just barely starting to round DH with a lot of very dense damp snow capping all of that.  My personal take away point for all of this is that while this deep dense snow is capping the weak layers if you do manage to trigger something  on the NE-NW upper elevations of the Southern Wasatch it will be big, deep, and not good.  I suspect that these rapid warmups will increase the likely hood of pulling one of these slides out by tipping the stress on the snow pack close to the breaking point. There is still A LOT of the upper north side of the Timp Massif that has not avalanched yet."""

I found other cornices very sensitive and with good visibility of the terrain below I stepped on a few larger ones to see what they would do.

What was interesting is that the stauchwall (bottom edge of the slab that released) was even with the bottom edge of the rocks. Below the rocks the snowpack is deeper but also the slope angle quickly lessens.

This slide released on a layer of facets about 3-4 inches beneath an obvious layer of dust. The dust is not a factor but just a good marker and a good way to find the location of these facets. See stripe of dust in the third photo below.

Locals who've been riding in this zone all winter have been avoiding similar terrain on bigger slopes. This slide is demonstrates the wisdom of that choice. Bigger north facing terrain near rock bands will likely produce bigger avalanches. Rocky areas tend to have weaker and more faceted snow. They also have lots of good trigger points.
","","","The buried rock in the pit wall in the photo below is a great example of a good trigger point on a slope.

Earlier in the day, we dug just under Clayton Peak first, found the dust layer, but nothing would break in my tests (ECT). This was an exposed windy location. Perhaps the faceted layer had been stripped off the snow surface before it was buried. Moved to the Rock Garden basin just east of Clayton and just north of Caribou. Dug the pit in the photo below. I purposely performed my ECT's above the rock in the pit wall to simulate being in a shallower rocky area. The ECT broke and propagated after 23 taps (ECTP23).

About 15 minutes after doing this test. My partner shot up the small slope and got this avalanche to break out. It was good confirmation of this avalanche problem and of the validity of my ECT next to the buried rock."

I watched as snow poured over the fifteen foot cliffs to our west and landed right in front of her before I lost sight of her.  I yelled her name, made sure I was out of the way of the slide, watched the debris flow by, and looked for signs of her.  I yelled her name a few times.  My original concern was that she was buried in a pile right where the snow had flowed on her.  I hoped she was just standing on the other side, able to stop above where the snow came down.  I looked down the chute and she was standing on the side about 75 feet below.  I had to wait for the last trickles of the slide to stop and then I skied down as fast as possible finding her goggles on the way.  When I got to her, she was shaken but okay.  I tried to look at all our options.  I thought maybe we could get onto the west facing flank, use that as safety and maybe a way down.  But we were in the heart of it.  I asked her if she could make her way down and she said, “Yup”  We came up with a plan to stay as close to the East side (as far away from any of the East facing slopes hanging above us) and jump from side pull out to side pull out one at a time.  We were near the bottom of the chute.  We quickly moved past the debris of the slide, over some rocks and we were “home free” onto the apron.  It seemed like forever and a heartbeat.  That is what adrenaline will do to you. 

 

Looking Back:

I thought that the forecast today was going to be very warm and would make it so we hiked up then ski right down.  We hiked over a lot of old avy debris while ascending the chute.  We thought maybe giving it a little more time would help ease the ski down.  When we reached the ridge at the top, numerous clouds formed blocking the sun.  It was rather cool and the snow up high was not softening as much as we had hoped.  We skied down about 800 feet with our buddy who had to go to work, but we decided to wait a bit longer.  We watched him ski out to almost the bottom where we couldn’t see him anymore and then hiked back up.  It remained cloudy and became breezy for the hike up and a brief waiting period.  We talked about how we should ski one at a time and pull off out of the way to watch the other person.  But I must admit, I was saying it for good practices, not because I was truly concerned.  I thought most southerly aspects had been cooked pretty well the last six days and our concern was skier triggered point releases.  We decided to head down at about 11:30am.  It wasn’t as soft as we hoped, but then about 1,000 feet down it started becoming very wet.  I was mostly concerned with push-a-lanches at this point and we were just trying not to ski above one another. 

After the slide, I had to make a quick decision where I thought we would be safe.  I asked my partner to get some consensus but she was pretty shaken.  I knew I had to keep calm and portray confidence.  There was still hang fire on both sides above us, although West facing was still not getting direct sun.  I thought maybe we could work the West facing side up onto the rocks but it seemed very technical and would take much longer.  I also thought of trying to find some high ground to wait it out or call for help.  But I thought there was enough snow on the slopes above that was warming, to not be a great idea.  We were near the bottom of the chute where there was almost no hang fire and so I decided we should go for it.  

I decided not to call Alta Central in the moment, as we were in a hurry to get out of there and my phone was tucked away.  I had thought to call when we got down, but then I hurried and got the car, took my partner to the clinic and rushed to work.  It seemed pointless after so long.  Though, in hindsight, I really wished I had called.  Calling is too easy for that mistake.  

Some background information:

This was my fifth time skiing Little Pine Chute, Mali’s first time, and Jason (our third skier) had skied it before.  We all had helmets on for the ascent and descent, whippets in hand, and we each brought crampons.  We had beacons on, shovel and probe in our packs.  I have been skiing in the backcountry for six years.  The last four winters I have only skied in the backcountry, roughly 150 days per year, and about an average of 4 hours per day skied.  I would not consider myself an expert.  But I am experienced and have spent a lot of time in avalanche terrain.  Mali is a competitive Freeride skier and an avid backcountry skier.   She was a collegiate Nordic skier and is very athletic (which I believed helped in our exit when she only had one ski).  Also, she is a raft guide in the summer and is more comfortable in rescue/”high stress” situations.  I think this helped both of us stay calmer and move efficiently out of the chute. 

 

I went back today to take some pictures.  I could not see where the slide started or traveled above the chute.  The chute looks entirely different when you are inside it.  This was my best guess as to where we were.

This avalanche was initiated by a single hand charge on Thursday March 8th, 2018. The route members tossed several shots onto a hanging snowfield on the eastern flanks of Silver Creek Peak without results. At approximately 8:30, the 2nd or 3rd shot placed in the area initiated a 2'x150' avalanche failing on the weak snow near the ground. The slide cascaded over the 80' to 100' cliff band and crashed onto the open bowl below. Slope angle was measured at this point. Upper field was likely closer to 32 degrees steepness. The resulting avalanche propagated over 1500' wide and stepped down from the initial faceted layer 140cm deep into basal facets as it reached numerous rock fingers lower in the bowl. The 1F hard slab broke apart and piled up on several of the benches below, and was eventually channeled into the gully systems below. Old tracks from former skiing parties in the lower drainage were obliterated and the debris piles were over 4 meters deep in places. The toe of the debris came to rest nearly 1750' below the placement of the explosive. The crown below the rock band averaged 150cm to 180cm, with its deepest point reaching 275cm. The 2/18 dirt layer is clearly visible throughout the crown and flanks, and even in the chucks of debris that were not pulverized.

They followed an existing skin track that generally ascended a run called Chutes and Ladders. See map image below for approximate location of the top of this run (image from Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Map).

They stopped at a bench and decided to go one at a time. Skier 1 was following a set of switchbacks uphill towards a dense patch of trees. This set of switchbacks climbed above this bench in between two gullies where the avalanche would ultimately run. At 1200 when Skier 1 was near 9000 feet, the avalanche released. This person was carried downhill about 200 vertical feet and stopped as the debris washed down the two gullies. Skier 1 was deposited on the bench in between the two gullies.

Skier 2 watched the avalanche release, put his hand on his airbag handle, and thought he might die. This was a massive avalanche and he knew that he was above a large cliff. When the avalanche hit him, he immediately deployed his air bag by pulling the handle. He was only carried 20 feet.

Skier 1 was using Fritschi Vipec bindings. When in walk mode, tech bindings are typically ""locked"" at the toe. The Vipec is slightly different in that the toe does not lock. Instead, in walk mode, it has a higher release value. It remains releasable which is an important safety feature if caught in an avalanche. In this case both of Skier 1's bindings released. (Side note - it is also critical to not wear wrist straps on your ski poles. Most experienced avalanche pros cut them off). It may not have made a difference in this case, but having your skis and poles separate from you in an avalanche is vital. Skis and poles that remain attached give the avalanche more to grab and pull you down. Additionally. pole straps prevent you from attempting to swim, dig into the bed surface, protect your airway, or take other actions.

Skier 1 found both of his skis, but one binding was broken. He was eventually able to ski out on one ski.

Once Skier 1 & 2 realized they were ok and had survived, they quickly became concerned about the potential that other people had been in the runout zone. Fortunately, at the time of the avalanche, no one was below and no one else was caught. There easily could have been. A group fo 7-8 people had been walking up the trail which follows the summer road. They were only dressed in light hiking gear and not prepared for avalanches. This avalanche occurred directly in front of them as they hiked uphill. This is a very popular area with users of all experience levels. In fact, when Skier 1 & 2 reached the bottom of the slope, there were at least 15 people in the area looking at this avalanche.

Photo below shows their approximate ascent route by the white line and their rough locations when the avalanche happened. Map below shows the top of the ""Chutes and Ladders"" run marked by a purple pin.","Kessler Peak is the crown of mid-Big Cottonwood Canyon and sits at 10,403'.  It has large avalanche paths nearly along its 360° perimeter and is the site of a number of avalanche accidents and fatalities over the years.  It is steep, rocky and studded with various cliff-bands, couloirs, and numerous gullies and terrain traps.  The Chutes and Ladders ski line is south of the Catcher's Mitt and north of the High/Deep Pockets area of the eastern flank of Kessler.  It is steep, east facing and the ski run starts at about 9700'.  See map image above.

Kessler Peak has very complex terrain. Many of the slide paths contain many different aspects. This variability leads to huge variability in the snowpack due to sun, wind, etc. Additionally the complex nature of the terrain means that there are very few clean runouts where you wouldn't hit rocks, trees or other terrain traps if caught in an avalanche.

","Lessons Learned (as reported by Skiers 1 & 2).

Thank you to both skiers for sharing their thoughts and information about the slide. They were totally honest and have opened themselves up to criticism by armchair quarterbacks. The only way we learn as a community is by sharing stories. The only way we learn as individuals is by reflecting on our actions and learning from them. -MS

This terrain was new to them. They had skied once Kessler once before via Argenta. Because it is such complex terrain, it can be difficult to know safe routes for ascent.  A recent study by Lees, Raspollini, and George found that 32% of skiers/boarders have been killed while going uphill. Read more HERE.
	They felt safe because they were following a skin track and observed 2 sets of downhill ski tracks. It is normal human nature to feel more safe in the company of others...or at least to see that someone else has gone there first. Unfortunately Persistent Slab Avalanches do not work that way. It can be the first person to trigger a slope or the 10th person. You never know.
	They feel that they did not pay enough attention to the weather, the advisory, the terrain, etc. The same could be said by all of us who've ever been involved in some accident whether it is avalanches, driving, etc. Many educators recommend slowing down. Digging a snowpit is a great opportunity to discuss everything. While the snowpit itself won't provide all the necessary information, it gives us a good opportunity to discuss everything. Besides, a snowpit just might yield a red flag that you would have missed otherwise and save your life. It only has to take 10 minutes.
	Lastly, they said that they never vocalized reasons why they thought following this skin track and climbing the east face of Kessler was a good idea. It might not have changed their minds but would have been a worthy discussion. ""It feels good"" is not good enough. Pretend your best friend just died and you are speaking to someone's their spouse, kids or parents. Would you have good reasons?

Email to UAC staff:

I’d like to buy new skis and bindings for the skier who lost his in the Chutes and Ladders slide. Could you put me in touch with him?

Staff Response:

That is incredibly kind and generous. We really appreciate your offer to that skier. It really helps us work on building a community in which we can share stories and report accidents without shame. It’s very powerful and we can’t express how much our entire staff appreciates your offer.

We forwarded your email to him.

Reply to staff response:

Well, you see, I was the one that set the skin track that took them into danger. Like them, I didn't know the area well and when I skinned it on Wednesday (to ski Catcher's Mitt, one of the best runs of my life), we started too far to the looker's left, coming up through Chutes and Ladders. We had a moment when we had to decide which way to go and we skinned over into trees, then across the face (where the avalanche broke) back to the ridge line leading into Catcher's Mitt. I knew as I was doing it that it was a terrible choice, but we had boxed ourselves in (ironically, by trying to get to a safe place). So we tried to make the best of it by going one by one across the face. I had my heart in my mouth the entire time.

Now that I've done it, and have seen the terrain by day (we started dawn patrol and were skinning up in the dark, going off the WBSkiing map to try to figure out the ridge line to follow up), I would skin it very differently, and perhaps would skip it altogether by following a better track up Argenta and dropping in through East Couloir as three other skiers did an hour or so after we had left the area on Wednesday. This experience has taught me many lessons (fed, in part, by your excellent write-up).

I know they needed to make their own choice as to where to skin up. I also think they were unwise to go out with the rapidly heated snow. BUT I also know that I did them a disservice by (unintentionally) setting a terrible skin track for them to follow, and I've done my fair share of dumb things touring, so I'd be a kettle calling the pot black if I were to try to blame them.

I can't imagine how much worse I'd feel if they'd been hurt. Replacing skis is cheap by comparison. I hope they'll reach out to me to let me get them some new gear.","A number of natural avalanches within the storm snow occurred on many aspects and elevations during the Sunday storm with a few stepping into old snow.  In the following days, the following avalanches were human triggered into old faceted snow either at the early/mid-Feb facet interface and/or at the depth hoar near the ground.

Lessons: We were at a lower elevation and in one of the outlying areas where the PWL is more present... The snow in the couloir felt stable on the ascent. As we approached the final roll to the top we did not re-group to discuss continuing. It was cold and shady in the couloir and the top looked like great views, sunny and warm. I have skied the couloir in the past and knew that the top always has the convex roll over from wind loading.  I was tricked because the stubborn hard  slab was capped with 6-8 inches of fresh snow on top.  Although it was convex and in retrospect was obviously wind loaded it did not feel slabby on top and the verts were punching through the new snow and it felt supportable. It did not seem like the same persistent slab that slid was present futher than 15 or 20 feet down the couloir.  We felt that the heavy windloading at the convex roll was what activated the layer. As soon as the second stepped onto the slope with the first on top of the slab, the increased load was enough to cause a collapse and take the second for a ride. 

Looking at the convex roll we should have skied from just below it and not have tried to push for the top of the couloir. Looking back, it was obviously wind loaded. The stoke was high as we could see the sun and the phenomenal powder. We should have SLOWED DOWN and better communicated our concerns. I'm glad my partner(s) are okay.

We found an easy cornice to drop, made sure no one was below, rigged an anchor to belay off of, and popped it off.

Which is the definition of a moderate hazard (""heightened avalanche conditions on specific terrain features, evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern""). Features of concern right now are steep northerly facing slopes that are weak and thin due to rocks, previous avalanches, etc.

We spotted this slide from the power lines. First photo shows the debris well. Second photo sort of shows a piece of the crown well. I would estimate it at 4 feet deep and wind loaded. The weak layer we found was about 2 feet deep. With wind load, 4 feet seems reasonable at the crown. We couldn't seen any rocks in the bed surface, so I think it did break in the middle of the snowpack.

Skiing was good with minimal wind affect in most of the sheltered W and NW aspect slopes. As we neared the bottom of the drainage there was a slighty more open slope with just a touch of south aspect off to skiers left that I went to check out to see if there had been sun affect from the afternoon before. This is small terrain, somewhat steep in the starting zone (40ish) just below small rock band, but then flattening out quickly below. To my surprise as I got over there the ssw aspect at the bottom of this drainage seemed to have a bit of hard wind slab on it. I was traversing fairly high on the slope but it fractured about 5 feet above me and propagated 30 feet wide or so. I was knocked off my feet and carried about 30 feet downhill and stopped sitting on the debris. No terrain traps present. I did have a chance to yell and my partner and another party in the area had eyes on me. This was as big of an avalanche as this terrain could have produced and was not really scary at all. However I will say that I was surprised at the presence of the wind slab in that area and it made me think that the winds from the night before could have made pockets of wind slabs in some other unusual places as well.

It ran full width and track of Toots. It also propagated to next gully and took out all of that. Crown was 18 to 30 inches, Soft Slab failing on thin crust just below storm snow from last 2 storms. It did not step down below this. Visibility was poor but it appeared we could see crowns all the way over to Depth Hoar Bowl. Pictures are poor due to time of day and poor vis. We were unable to obtain more info on crown profile etc., due to time of day, air temps. Poor decision to ski that particular slope but came home safe due to terrain management and good communication. ","","","Forecaster (Hardesty) Comments:  this was a very experienced party known for making thought out and conservative decisions.  I'd reiterate that their tracks were on 32-33 degree terrain...but the hard slab/facet structure propagated back up and south to 44 degree terrain.  We dug along the skier's left flank near where the first skier stopped and did not find alarming structure or test results.  The depth of the snowpack and weakness of the facets varied wildly across the crown and flanks.  Crown ranged from 1-3' deep.  As noted the first skier pulled out to skier's left a couple hundred feet down the slope; the second skier collapsed the slope and not caught.  The slide came within 10' of where the first skier stopped. "

Mark White:

Saw this skier triggered avalanche while hiking out of South Monitor and went to investigate it. Looked to be the fifth person to ski the slope, and looked like he hit a thin spot in the snow pack and triggered the slide. Luckily he triggered it right on the flank and was not in danger of burial. The debris pile was at least 20ft deep, my probe would not reach the ground fully extended. The slide looked to have taken out the snow from our last two little storms and the bigger storm from yesterday, sliding on the hard crust from the warm spell before that. The boarder was about a quarter of the way down the slope when he triggered it and it fractured across and up-slope of the trigger point. Luckily he wasn't in the gut of it or it most likely would have had not ended well.

Mike Dawson:

Three separate parties arrived at the top of West Monitor in quick succession. My party of two skiers descended first, without incident or any signs of instability. Shortly thereafter, while my party was ascending the skin track at the north end of the bowl, the second party of two also skied the bowl without incident. While the second party was at the base of the bowl, a solo snowboarder, the fifth rider to enter, remotely triggered an avalanche. (I gathered the following information from the boarder and the members of the second party). The avalanche started above and to the north of him, when he was approximately 30% through his run. The party below yelled up to alert the boarder, who immediately bee-lined it to the bottom. The avalanche fan caught up to him at the bottom but he stayed upright, having only been partially buried over his boots. The boarder lost his poles, which he dropped to hasten the bee-line, but was happy to be alive and uninjured. The party of two at the base of the bowl during the avalanche were also lucky to have been able to side step the deposition at the toe.

Other Observations. This is a repeater avalanche, the first two times being in late December and mid January. Prior to yesterday’s storm, West Monitor had been heavily tracked. In spite of the wind that accompanied the storm, the new snow had no signs of slabbing or instability. Cornice cuts on the ridge yielded only minor sluffing. The avalanche ran completely in the new snow and did not step down into the old faceted layers. In retrospect, although the the new snow had no visible signs of slabbing from yesterday’s storm, there were red flags: 1. West Monitor is a repeater. No repeater is to be trusted until it’s bed surface is pouring out of your faucet in the Spring; 2. West Willow (another infamous repeater) had slid during the storm or shortly afterwards. We had observed the presence of the Willow slide earlier in the morning; 3. The avalanche advisory reported soft slab avalanche from control work in the same area with similar aspect, angle and elevation (although during the storm); 4. West Monitor had been receiving full sun throughout the morning, and this is a factor later in season (is it really later in the season, already!!!); 5. As I stood at the top of the bowl discussing the health of a buddy who had recently been caught and seriously injured in an avalanche, I had an instinctive twinge of reservation about skiing the bowl. Although me and my partner skied the bowl, ourselves, without incident, we realize now that we were just mighty lucky, as were the second party and the boarder who just happen to draw the short straw. I will be trusting instincts and staying away from repeaters for the remainder of 2018.

[Forecaster Comment - Excellent writeup and retrospection of considering dropping into avalanche terrain. Although this may have been a repeater from earlier in the season, the slide ran on a stout sun crust that formed during the week of February 5. Two small storms (Saturday Feb 10 and Monday Feb 12) fell on top of this crust, followed by the larger storm on Thursday Feb 15. This avalanche took out the storm snow from these three recent storm events, and did not run on weaker faceted layers that would be present in slide paths from repeater avalanches.]

A party of two ran into a mutual friend that was travelling solo. They decided to join as a group of three. They were skiing in the Silver Fork drainage of Big Cottonwood Canyon in the Meadow Chutes area on Friday January 26. This avalanche occurred on their 6th run in the area. They had already skied El Rollo once, and the Football Field twice, in addition to other runs.

None of them had skied the actual section that avalanched. They skied just to the south (or skier's right) of the area that avalanched (see the image below). Skier 1 and Skier 2 descended and stopped in the runout zone of the area that subsequently avalanched (the red X's mark their approximate location in the image below). The avalanche released while Skier 3 was descending, and first noticed it, and yelled ""avalanche!"" Skier 1 heard the warning, and quickly moved approximately 10 feet to the north, and avoided being caught. Skier 2, who was taking a photo, was not able to move out of the way and was caught by the descending avalanche. He was carried 600 vertical feet and found on the surface of the debris with his head down hill. The total distance the avalanche ran was a 1000 vertical feet down.

This avalanche was remotely triggered which means no one was on the part of the slope that actually avalanched. Skier 3 was skiing to the side of it and Skiers 2 and 3 stationary underneath it. 

At the time, the severity of the avalanche and the consequential terrain below led them to think that Skier 2 must have been killed. Skier 1 and Skier 3 pulled out their beacons and started searching below. As Skier 3 descended through a steep 45-50 degree slope with bent-over aspens he yelled to Skier 2 who responded. Skier 2 was injured severely enough that they could not self evacuate and called for help.

The first people to arrive on scene were Solitude Ski Patrollers operating under Wasatch Backcountry Rescue. They hiked into Silver Fork on foot. A LifeFlight Helicopter landed on the avalanche debris and delivered Skier 2 to the medical clinic at Solitude where he was transferred to an ambulance and driven to a hospital. Skiers 1 and 3 skied out.

The avalanche danger for the day was rated CONSIDERABLE. link found HERE.","The slope that avalanched is in the Upper Meadow Cutes area of Silver Fork Canyon (it can be found on the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Map). It's an easterly facing slope with variations of convexities and concavities, the top of the slope is comprised of a long ridge that mainly runs north to south with many popular backcountry skiing runs off this ridge. This particular slope starts out lower angled but quickly breaks over to 38 degrees in steepness. The starting zone does have a northerly component to the slope making it more northeast rather than east like many of the other runs nearby. The slope maintains a slope angle of 33 degrees before flattening out to a bench. Below this bench is a very steep break over that ends in another flat section (terrain trap) before reaching the summer road. This lower bench is 45-50 degrees in slope steepness and has many shrubs, small aspen trees, and small scattered pines which could result in severe consequences if carried through this terrain.  ","This avalanche happened on Friday, Jan 26 at 3 p.m. A representative weather station four miles to the NW on Reynolds Peak, strong south winds blew from Wednesday afternoon until Thursday afternoon (Jan 24 - Jan 25). They were averaging 20-40 mph with gusts up to 65 mph. (See graph below)

Snowfall began after these strong south winds ended in the afternoon of Jan 25. Most of the snow fell that afternoon and evening.

Snow containing 0.4 inches of snow water equivalent fell at the Spruces station at 7402 feet.
	Snow containing 0.64 inches of snow water equivalent fell at the Collins station at 9662 feet.
On the morning of the avalanche, winds at the Reynolds station were blowing westerly 10-15 mph with gusts up to 20 mph.","A couple of initial comments about this accident.


	The rescue and the response to this avalanche happened incredibly fast. It was 2 hours from the time the avalanche happened until Skier 2 was delivered to an ambulance. He sat in the snow for 2 hours getting colder by the minute. ALWAYS BE PREPARED BECAUSE IT COULD TAKE MUCH LONGER if you don't have reception for your cell phone, if a helicopter is not immediately available, if there is not a good landing zone nearby (the helicopter landed right next to this skier), if there is bad weather or darkness, or any other number of reasons that complicate rescue.
	This group has a huge amount of experience skiing in the backcountry, well over 60 years. It's very tricky to accurately assess stability.
	This was their 6th run in the area. Don't trust the snowpack we have this year because there are a lot of booby traps out there.
	With persistent slab avalanches and remotely triggered slides, runout zones include terrain beneath adjacent slide paths. 
	DON'T STAND IN RUNOUT ZONES.

","Via email - 

I noticed something in your excellent report on the accident in Silver Fork, which I thought worth mentioning. It's clear in the images that the slope had been skied many times prior to the wind/water event of 1/24-25. The old tracks do not follow 'Skier 1's' more conservative line, but dump right over that nasty roll. This might be an illustration of the common mistake of thinking you (I) made an OK decision because we (I) skied something and it didn't avalanche. It creeps me out to consider how many times in my ski career I was a gnat's eyelash from tripping the trigger. Another great reason not to judge other's mistakes through the lens of hindsight.

I hate and fear that slope. Perhaps because I remotely triggered a similar slide onto my ski partner, Doug C., in 1984 (the year not the book). Doug was standing on the same bench as Skier 1 and 2.

Unfortunately, we did not learn our lesson and Doug was killed a year later in Water Hollow. I miss him.

I'm not sure how useful this comment might be. But perhaps it will, if shared, help people make better decisions and ski with humility; two things I struggle with every winter.

Thank you for your quality work.

Fred Henion","","From one of the members of the party - ""Skier 1"" - Thanks for the excellent write up with further recollection, it was our 6th run.also one takeaway from this is do not let your guard down,and try to stay away from all runout zones not just the ones you are skiing. I was very lucky!!!! But was on point ready to scamper as I did . I am sure I was missed by just a few feet."

Before deciding to ski two of our group dug hand pits to the surface on the slightly lower angle about 20 feet above the eventual crown line. We found the same layers and facets we have been seeing on the ridge this season but neither produced easy sheer or collapse.

The first skier entered the slope and triggered the slide on his second turn. It broke approximately 5 to 10 feet above him and around 100 feet wide. He immediately tried to cut right but was caught and carried through the smaller aspen trees. Airbag was deployed about 1/3rd of the way down the slope and skier remained on top of the slide coming to rest roughly 20 to 30 feet above the toe.

Skier was not injured and after a 20 minute search both skis were located 2 to 3 feet deep just above where the skier stopped. Fortunately it was not needed but a big thank you to the PC (Canyons) patrol for their willingness to come out and assist.

Forecaster note: A huge thank you to this party for providing a write up about his incident. It helps all of us learn more about avalanches, become safer, and hopefully come home safely every day. Also, all three people were carrying avalanche transceivers, probes and shovels.

","","","From the skier caught in the avalanche:

On my third lap in No Name Bowl today I remotely triggered a large slide which caught and carried me approximately 500’. The deep slab broke approximately 120’ above me. I’d skied the bowl 48 hrs ago and noted the entire bowl was tracked repeatedly. The underlying surface felt solid. Today there were between 9 and 11 people skiing the bowl in various groups. While there had been some dense sluffing on the first lap, it didn’t feel concerning. Concern diminished further as the bowl was quickly tracked up. As I waited for my third lap at the top I noted that there remained only a couple of alleys of clean snow. One was just north of the high point on the crest of the bowl. At the top of the alley lies a steep rocky section which will often release if touched. I chose a line slightly north of this point with the plan to move south once I was several turns into the run. After cutting into the run and feeling solid I began to descend. There was once again some sluffing but it actually felt lighter than earlier with less volume. On approximately my fifth turn I was hit by the slab and knocked over. I was buried briefly and then spat out. That cycle continued 3-5 times until I came to a stop sitting in the debris. I’m speculating that the slope angle above me combined with the persistent slab and the weight of the new snow produced this one. I’m still shocked though that between 18-21 runs prior to mine, within 60 min of mine in fact, and with some releasing sizable and long running heavy sluffs, did not pull this out. I feel pretty damn lucky today.

Thought I'd submit this in addition to Brett Carroll's avalanche report. We were up there around 3:00 pm and had enough visibility to get a photo. Impressive slide! Looks like it's a bit bigger than he reported. Arrows show a good size pocket that pulled out in addition to the main slide. I'd say the slide encompasses over 2/3rds of the bowl. Didn't get closer than where I took the photo from but it looked to be to the ground (as previously reported) and ran full track. Considering the slabby upside down feel to the snow on our up and significant winds reloading snow rapidly, thought it might have been a natural. Enough cracking going on and rotten snow near the ground to see how this could have easily been remotely triggered.

Overall not as touchy conditions as I was expecting, and this was the only slope we could get to releas along Twin Lakes Pass ridgeline. This was despite most of the leeward, east-facing terrain having been wind-loaded from westerly winds.

On our way from Twin Lakes Pass to the Emma's Ridge and Sliver Fork, I went to look into Solitude's Honeycomb Canyon at the saddle about where the Alta snowcat typically turns around.  This is probably something I've done many times just to check out the view.

Knowing there are large cornices along this ridgeline, I walked to a spot to the right of the saddle where I could see dirt and rocks and would not stand on the cornice.  On my way back to the saddle, perhaps as I moved from the more rocky area to a marginally thicker snowpack, the cornice broke about 5 feet from me.  The lip of the cornice was perhaps 8 feet from me.  As is typically the case, this broke bit farther back than I expected.  This cornice was quite large and caused a good sized avalanche below.  

West/southwest winds have been blowing the last two days and prior to the cornice breaking you could see new growth on the cornice.  Perhaps this made it more sensitive. 

Immediately after the cornice broke, I called Solitude Dispatch to let them know nobody was caught.  This avoided Solitude sending patrollers to look for anyone who may have been caught.  Honeycomb Canyon was closed at the time so there were no skiers below.

The day before the incident, the 21 yr. old son asked his dad if he should climb the hill. The dad said no because it was steep and looked suspect because it had more snow than the surrounding area; he had also seen it slide in previous years. The family does not carry avalanche rescue equipment and actively avoids avalanche terrain. No one has ever taken an avalanche class. The son did not climb the hill that day.

The next day the family went to same spot. While the daughters were riding in the flats below hill, the son went up the hill and climbed up the ridge to the looker's left unbeknownst to anyone.

He unknowingly triggered the slide from the ridge above and looker's left. Once getting to the top, he pointed his sled straight downhill not knowing there had been an avalanche. He flipped off the crown and over the handlebars. The debris stopped the sled. The sled was damaged because of the fall. It took the family a while to get the sled out as the debris chunks were big and hard. The bed surface was almost down to the dirt.

Dad though his son had a little bit of bravado in his decision to climb.

It is likely the west/northwest winds on 12/22 and 12/23 created the  4"" 1F slab on top of the faceted layer where the failure occurred.

Avalanche activity on mid and upper elevation slopes facing north through east, and continued reports of collapsing and cracking, throughout the week prior to this incident indicated continued instability.

 ","This was a classic persistent slab avalanche:

1. There were numerous tracks on adjacent slopes with no evidence of avalanching;

2. The fourth skier on the slope triggered the avalanche.

With a persistent (or deep) avalanche problem, tracks on a slope are zero indication of stability. All it takes is for one person to find a weak spot and the entire slope can avalanche, taking out prior tracks. These types of avalanches also allow a rider to get well out onto a slope before avalanching, and it is not uncommon for the avalanche to fracture widely - and above the rider.

From reports we have received, more than one skier was on the slope when it avalanched. It is crucial to only expose one person at a time on a slope, and get out of the runout zone at the bottom, and then wait for the next rider to enter the slope.

Our current persistent slab structure can easily be identified by digging down 1 to 3' deeply in the snowpack. If you find the structure of strong snow (denser, harder to penetrate) over weak snow (softer, easier to penetrate) this is evidence of a poor snowpack structure, and the types of slopes that should be avoided. In the Wasatch mountains, this problem currently exists on mid and upper elevation slopes facing north through east.

Dry Fork Avalanche...Contributing Factors/Accident debrief 

On Friday, 12/29/17, around 10:30-11 am, there was an avalanche accident involving 3 clients, while I was leading a group of 8 guests with another established guide and one aspirant guide.

We decided to ski an east-facing slope of about 35 degrees: the middle entrance to Dry Fork from Alta. This slope had been skied over the previous few days without incident. I dug a hand- pit down to the facet layer and it was not reactive.

The 10 sets of tracks and an up-track on the middle entrance proper pushed me to find a cleaner line for my clients. I was lured right by untracked snow, and decided to open up slightly steeper adjacent terrain. I ski cut about 120 feet south and then skied fall-line for 250 feet, and back north to an island of safety at the bottom of the short pitch.

Although the snowpack was unreactive to my ski cut and run, I did feel some apprehension. However, I thought the run could be safely skied by individual skiers going one at a time.

The second guide, perhaps thinking he needed to be lower on the slope to keep an eye on clients as they skied further right, made a few turns on the slope to a tree. The first client then followed my traverse, and the 2nd client followed just 20 feet behind him. Then, as I watched in horror from below, 3rd client followed onto the starting zone, another 30 feet behind.

Before any of them had actually turned down the fall-line, 3 were on the traverse and it fractured about 100 wide and 2.5 feet deep, pretty much connecting the dots between them. Crown was just above the clients. All 3 were carried 100 - 200 feet. Two lost skis, but all 3 stopped without injury. Two were partially buried, but dug themselves out. One ski was not recovered.

Human Factors: 

This was a party of 11 people. We intended to split the party at the bottom of this first pitch of skiing, but we were all together to start. Communication somehow broke down and three people skied at once.

Due to low snowpack, most safe slopes in the upper Cottonwoods had already been skied by multiple parties. My decisions were affected by scarcity.

My previous guiding days in this early season had been avalanche training, where there was no reason to be on steeper terrain. These experienced, enthusiastic clients were back for their 4th season with me, and I was eager to get them out of the tracks on Point Supreme and give them some decent powder.

Second guide and I agreed on a plan “A” to ski the middle entrance to Dry Fork, but I changed to plan A+ by opening up the terrain to skier’s right.

Weather: 

We skied at 10:30-11 am, on an East aspect, and it was a warm, sunny day..

Terrain: 

This slope was 40 degrees with some rocks in bed surface. Middle entrance proper was 35. "

At 12"" to 18"" deep and 150 to 200ft wide this would have caused serious issues for anybody caught in its path. It slid 100 plus feet into the trees below, with it piling up between 3 and 5 feet on the trees in its path. Under the soft slab there was over a foot of facets that went straight to the ground, I'd bet this will be a repeater slide throughout the season.

We had two significant storms in late December - one on the 23rd and the other on the 25th that added additional weight to the slope. Wind on the night of the 27th likely caused additional loading to the slope - which was too weak to support the additional snow. The faceted snow (weak layer) was formed by dry and cold periods of weather in October, November, and December.

They felt the trees would offer some degree of safety from the known avalanche danger.  When they triggered the persistent slab avalanche, both riders were caught, but one was able to ride clear of the flank of the avalanche. The other was caught and carried through the trees. When he was caught, the 20-year-old rider immediately deployed his avalanche airbag and held tightly on to his sled as he was swept downhill into a large tree, his ankle pinned between his sled and the tree. The heavily damaged snowmobile was deeply buried and the rider mostly buried, with just part of his head and airbag sticking visible. It took a long time and lots of digging for the party to get both the rider and his sled extracted.  After about 45 minutes of digging, the slightly injured and very lucky rider was freed, and the party was able to get the damaged sled out of the backcountry and to the Franklin Basin trailhead.

 ","The avalanche occurred on treed north facing slope in mid-Boss Canyon at around 8500' in elevation.  The riders were under the impression that avalanche conditions would be safer in the trees than on open slopes.","Two moist storms ending on Christmas Day deposited 25"" of snow and almost 4"" SWE as measured by the Tony Grove Snotel, about 5 miles to the south of the avalanche site.   Constant westerly winds battered the northern Bear River Range during this time, and a slab was formed on weak faceted snow from the 3-week-long December high pressure system.","","Email from buried rider's mother: 

""Hi, the avalanche at Boss Canyon yesterday involved my son.  I am so thankful for the countless hours they spend in your classes learning and observing.  Thankful for proper gear and for the outcome of this event.  His brother and dad and uncle are the ones that dug him out.  So many mixed emotions as they were digging him out and can't imagine how they would have felt had he not made it.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!""","Looking down the avalanche path is pretty scary!

I made the Steep Hollow video not far away on the same day the avalanche occurred.  Unstable snow was widespread, the avalanche danger was HIGH and and we had continued an Avalanche Warning. ","http://unofficialnetworks.com/2017/12/29/utah-snowmobiler-digs-brother-out-of-avalanche-credits-avalanche-airbag-for-survival/

From Fox 13 news story:

A snowmobiler was saved by his brother after getting buried in a football field sized avalanche near the Utah-Idaho border near the Franklin Basin of Logan Canyon this week. FOX 13 SLC reports the buried snowmobiler was found by his avalanche airbag which he had deployed in the slide:

“I called over the radio and said, “Avalanche. Avalanche. Trace was buried. When I finally saw the airbag and it was against the tree, I just, I mean: Worst case scenario is what comes to mind. I started running towards him, he’s only 50 yards away from me up the hill, but with that deep of snow it felt like it took me an hour to get to him. He kept saying, ‘hurry, hurry my leg,’ and we couldn’t dig fast enough. Time stood still. Everything we did just seemed too slow.”

After a 45 minute struggle, Trace’s brother and uncle we able to free him and while his snowmobile was crushed, Trace was thankfully uninjured. Trace’s brother credits the airbag for his brother’s survival:

“We would not have found him. He would have been completely buried. That [avalanche air bag] is what saved his life. He would have been completely under.”

The Utah Avalanche Center wants to remind us to always check conditions before recreating in the mountains and to ensure you have the right gear. The Francis family expressed their sincere gratitude for those at the Utah Avalanche Center and the work they do.

When we approached closer we came into contact with a lone skier. He stated that he was skiing some low angle terrain adjacent to the West Scotts slide path. He looked into West Scotts and stated that it was it was clear of any slides before he skied. When he stopped at the bottom to skin up he noticed the slide. He stated that it released remotely. He confirmed that he was the only skier in the area. When we skinned further up to investigate we noticed several cracks originating from his ski track.

As we neared the ridge the slope angle increased and the terrain grew rocky, and by the time we were within a switchback of the ridge we were gapping out as far as we could on the slope. While I waited in a corner beneath the ridge, my partner made one final switchback toward a break in the rocks. When he was 30 feet away, a soft slab broke out just above him, and carried him a short distance downhill. However, the slab propagated quickly into the corner in which I stood, and carried me about 150-200 feet down the slope, at which point I managed to grab a tree. No injury or burial, fortunately.

I was skiing fast and close to the shoulder this shot descends along, and I was turning back toward the ridge when I saw the slab fracture out to my right, and I fell onto my hip to grab the bed surface as blocks of snow washed around me into the gully below. The slide ran down the slope to the lower angled terrain below the upper faces and left a size 2 debris pile. I left one ski either up on the slope or in the debris pile. I did not remain on the slope to investigate the weak layer, take pictures, or generally take stock of the event, and although there was good visibility at the time of the event, the slope was obscured for the remainder of the day and so I was not able to look up to get another view of what happened. 

Little Superior SE facing was obviously not a good choice on a morning after several days of snow of variable densities, NW wind, and avalanches. I did push some snow down off the summit of Little Superior, which ran harmlessly a hundred feet or so and provided a very faint false positive. I skied several runs yesterday on S facing Alta and did not observe any instability, and yesterday's Cardiff Bowl slide was not visible on the ascent. I assumed that the previous day's instability had settled out, which in hindsight was not a well founded assumption given the overnight conditions, and which is arguably not something one ought ever to just ""assume."" I ski in the hellgate/superior zone frequently and generally in S facing LCC terrain quite a lot, and although I firmly acknowledge that the terrain west of Cardiff Peak is substantially more complex and exposed than the terrain btw Cardiff and Grizzly (not that the rest of it is at all benign), I have sometimes allowed my sense of when it should be left alone to be subordinate to my jonesing for those more appetizing fall lines.

At the first little steep pitch below the rocky rollover we were chatting, heads down following the skin track. All of a sudden we heard yelling to watch out and a lone skier had triggered a small, soft wind slab on to us. There was not that much snow, but it was enough to knock my partner of balance and he was pulled 30 ft down hill and both skis were pulled off (his toes were both locked). We spent the next 30 minutes searching for his lost ski. Everyone was okay and we proceeded to cautiously ski a few runs of awesome powder. We continued to experience lost of cracking, but managed terrain, kept our slope angle low, and stayed off wind loaded slopes. 

Lessons and takeaways:
1) I have seen this slope avalanche many times. If i am setting the skinner I keep it tight to the trees and make 35 switchbacks instead of 1 out on to the slope. I know this, but I was being lazy and following what was already there. NOTE TO SELF: ""don't be lazy! set the correct skin track and always assume nobody knows what they are doing.""
2) The mountains could care less that humans call it spring and UAC has stopped issuing advisories. Avalanches can and will happen when it snows.
3) The lone skier was being attentive and was actually trying to avoid the skin track and got turned around and ended up right on top of us. While he could have picked a safer line, it is our responsibility to avoid being on and under dangerous slopes. The chances that the slope could have gone naturally today are actually pretty good. We should have been paying more attention and reset the skin track in a better place. ","","",""

Lower Grizzly Gulch is a notorious terrain trap, and in 2013 a skier-triggered avalanche occurred in this area, with a full burial. The slide we saw today occurred just west of where this accident occurred.

This is the type of terrain where even a small slide can be fatal as the avalanche debris is deposited at the bottom of a very steeply-sided gully where even a small amount of snow can produce a deep pile of debris.

Viewed from Brighton Back Bowl area. Slide may have been up to 1/2 mile wide. From the activity observed in the Brighton Periphery, it appears that this slide would have been a Storm Slab with a contributing Wind aided factor. Of note, in the Brighton area, there was a significant density break issue directly above the old snow new snow interface from yesterdays 4 to 6 inches where it interfaced with the new 15 inches from Monday night into mid morning hours on Tuesday. Speculation would have the possibility of a Melt Layer Recrystallization occurring at the melt freeze layer prior to Mondays event under the minimal melt freeze that occurred Monday afternoon due to daytime highs and ambient heating. Regardless, whether this is true or not, there was a definite density break issue at this layer. The wide propagation was unusual and propagation was able to be initiated by our parties in many areas where wind loading had consolidated the Storm Slab. In the Brighton area, these were soft slabs ranging from 24 to 8 inches deep, with widths of up to 150 feet. They ran to transitions.

We visited this avalanche today (March 9th).  What really stood out to me was the width of this slide. It was easily 250 feet wide or more. It was the result of down slope winds that formed a wind slab on top of soft snow that fell during the Sunday/Monday storm (March 5/6). As we approached the site, the stratigraphy was obvious (always is in hindsight) as our skis punched through the wind slab into the softer snow underneath it.

The wind slab was really hard and the snow underneath was really soft. This combination alone can makes good avalanches; however..... I don't think we heard of or observed any faceting of the new snow on Tuesday, but it's entirely possible. This place can get warm then cool significantly which could have faceted the snow surface just a little bit. It was hard to tell looking at the snow crystals. They were mostly broken, decomposing stellars.

Isolated problem and I would be surprised to see more like it.

I believe that warming due to sun exposure contributed to the avalanche, as several tracks had been made down the same portion of the face earlier in the day, most likely when the wind slab was colder, harder, and more stubborn. The slide ran faster and farther than I would have expected, entraining quite a bit of snow on the way down. 

A couple thoughts on the human factor aspect of this avalanche:
- Social acceptance: My friend was visiting from Moab, had never skied off Superior before, and was excited to check it out. Perhaps this influenced me to overlook some signs of wind loading. 

Tracks: This was a big one. Nearly 2 dozen people had skied the South Face on a variety of aspects before we dropped in, without incident. In the past I have considered other tracks to be a reasonable sign of stability when dealing with a wind slab hazard when there is no persistent weak layer involved.

Wind was the story today in upper LCC. Though the wind was blowing out of the S/SW, most of the high terrain was subject to some combination of wind scouring and cross loading of hard wind slabs due to eddying and convective upcanyon winds meeting the upper level winds. My partner and I were headed for the coalpit headwall, but after climbing and skiing the Hogum Hobgack and looking up the Hypodermic Needle, we were not convinced topping out would be feasible. Snow whirls were eddying up the chute and snow was pluming off the top of the headwall. ""Let's head partway up and assess.""
As we started up the bottom of the hypo, one party ahead of us head already topped out and another party was near the top. One quarter of way up the ascent, wind slab avalanche debris from a moderate sized slide came down the needle at us. My partner Mike made a quick move to ski down and out of the way. Shortly after, a party of 3 skied down to us. The first skier reported that even though the snow surface had seemed like bulletproof wind slab on the ascent, he had triggered a slightly softer wind slab on the descent on the skiers right (leeward side of cliffband). The slide carried him 300' and he went under at one point but ended up on top. The slide ran about 600' total and was not huge, but certainly enough to bury a person (pic 1).
We all decided to bail and head down Hogum Fork. On the way down, in the bottom of the drainage, I ski cut a small but steep rollover in otherwise benign terrain that released a wind slab up to 3' deep (pic 2).","","",""

I was sent free-falling over the 35' cliff. I somehow landed safely and continued to get towed 250' feet down the tight couloir.
In the air, I just kept thinking ""this is how I die"", ""this is how I die"". Once I was on the ground and getting tossed I began fighting as hard as I could to get any purchase and fight my way to the side of the chute. Amazingly enough I was able to fight my way out and let the snow pass by me.
Once I had stopped moving I began swearing repeatedly, while evaluating myself for injury. My thumb hurt a bit and that was it. I yelled to to my touring partner Grey, ""I'm okay!"" I quickly booted up some to a safer spot in case another slide came down.
Luckily Grey had enough rope to get himself down the rappel and collect my skis, which had been ripped off my pack.

Even though the slide was relatively small, it picked up speed as it funneled into the choke and I was in a very exposed location. Very the consequences weee dramatically amplified.

The individual rode on top,  and once the dust cloud had settled he was standing up brushing himself off, and he told the first responders he was ok and then rode off. The cornice was school bus size. The initial impact of the cornice triggered a 30 foot wide area of snow in the high cliff line under the cornice. This release was probably only 45 to 60 cm deep, and the likely weak layer at this location was Basal Facets/Advanced Facets. It was extremely rocky. Once this piece of the avalanche descended into the open bowl it stepped down to the Rain Crust / Melt Freeze Crust layer from three weekends ago. The structure of the slab was from top down was 45 cm of pencil, then an interface where the hardness changed to 40 cm of one finger. Then there was a 3 cm  weak layer that was fist hard, and it was .5 mm facets showing signs of rounding. The bed surface was the slick crust that formed three weekends ago during the torrential rain event in early February.

Just above the entrance, I made a ski cut which triggered a shallow wind slab on the backside. The slab, which had been sloughing slightly below my feet on a slow, low pressure traverse, unexpectedly broke two feet above me as I gained speed and propagated about 40 ft between 2 and 6 inches deep. I was able to immediately self-arrest with a whippet, but the slide (while staying shallow) carried over a midslope cliff and propagated far wider in the lower bowl from the force of the drop.  

Because we were separated by 100 feet of similarly exposed terrain which hadn't slid, neither of us felt comfortable traversing to meet on top. After confirming our plan by radio, I descended the bed surface (which was still quite slabby) mostly side stepping above the cliffs until I could cut out towards lower consequence terrain. I then spotted my partner as he descended an adjacent lower angled bowl which did not slide. 

Once reunited, we debriefed and skied out to the S Turns. ","","","Take Aways: 

1) Manageable slabs are not manageable in extreme terrain. Use a rope or turn around even if you think it will probably be fine. I knew it was a high-consequence situation but thought I could manage my way alone through the red flags. The slides I have intentionally triggered have always broken near my feet, so I assumed that with so little snow above me that would be the case this time as well. 

2) Risk/Communication drift while in exploring mode: My partner and I did not research the beta well enough to know that HOD was the second chute down the ridge. When we came to the first chute, we were confused by the lack of anchors. Becuase I was faster and in charge of setting the rappel, I moved ahead focusing on problem-solving and finding our entrance rather than communicating deeply about our new uncertainty. 

Because I assumed I could manage the slab risk on the traverse and the ski map indicated that our chute was close, I moved out to scout even though my partner was still transitioning from a downclimb. Although I communicated my plan, I was moving too fast for the situation and if I had taken a ride this lack of preparation could have been deadly. Ultimately, I was still in an uphill mountaineering mindset even though we had started to descend avalanche terrain: ""How can I make this work"" vs. ""how to we mitigate what might go wrong."" In the future, I plan to consciously slow down and do a group risk assessment whenever something unexpected happens. This incident was an exceptionally cheap lesson. "

Remembering skier reports from the day before about soft slabs/sluff and seeing the soft slab debris we ruled out the Needle and decided to test the east face of the hogback. The skin track and initial turns didn't result in any movement of snow, but each skier was able to initiate separate very slow moving soft slab avalanches during each run.

One member of the party triggered a slab that propagated about 50' and was 6 to 18 inches deep indicating some wind effect though the snow density was mostly consistent and dry. Upon inspection it appeared that the new snow failed on about an inch of small graupel sitting on a pencil hard crust caused by the rain and warm temps before this storm. 
On our next run I triggered a very similar avalanche. This one was on a North facing slope and was significantly wider (200') as I intentionally cut the slope for a long distance. After I finished the cut the slope continued to propagate. This slope was smaller and the avalanche only traveled 150' downhill. 
Based on observations on the skin track and slope cuts on the descent the new snow is very sensitive only above 9,000'. I think this is because we have a rain/ melt freeze crust from last weeks warmth up to over 10k. Then last nights storm started as rain (or at least had very warm temps) below 9,000' that allowed for very good bonding to the old snow below that elevation. However, above the initial rain line the snow is still very sensitive sitting on a grauple layer that is sitting on a crust.

The first occurred around 12:30pm and was called in by a maintenance worker. It covered both lanes with 3-5' of debris. The highway was immediately closed and northbound traffic was turned around while remaining southbound vehicles were ushered through once the plow cleared a single lane. The avalanche was a wet, loose avalanche likely triggered by a sudden spike in rain intensity as the rain/snow line ascended in elevation. The snowpack in that path was roughly 70-90 cm so the rain percolated through to the ground quickly. The avalanche ran only about 150' vertical. 

A second avalanche just to the south of the first occurred at approximately 1pm and also covered both lanes of the highway though not as deeply, 1-3 feet. It too only ran about 150' vertical. One remaining public vehicle was able to drive through the deposition of the second though only with 4wd. It was decided then to not allow UDOT workers into the area to clear due to the continuing danger.

A third avalanche hit the road  at about 1:30pm landing in between the first two. This one ran about 300' vertical with a much higher starting point in the path. It appears to have been triggered by strong winds and subsequent roller balls. It widened out to about 40' and entrained more snow on the way down. It too covered both lanes of the highway. (see video below of third - poor quality)

No other significant avalanche activity was noted in the canyon during that time though there were signs of instability like roller balls everywhere.

The avalanche failed on a thin layer of faceted snow above a crust that formed on January 18th when we had a warming trend along with high pressure. A series of storms came across northern Utah on the 20th and lasted until the 26th of January. The mountains along the Park City ridge line received roughly 45"" inches of new snow with 3"" inches of water over the course of six days. This avalanche was triggered the first sunny day after a storm and the avalanche danger was rated considerable for that aspect and elevation.

 

Comments by witness party:  Our party of four were doing laps in the Home Run cirque, and on the way home via the Sound Of Music, discovered a fresh and large slide path with obvious crown and large debris pile far below in the aspens. Below the side path a short distance was the party of 3 or 4 who were milling around doing nothing, so we assumed it was them that triggered it and no one was hurt or in need of assistance. This slide was directly off the skiiers right side of the SOM, which typically gets a sun crust between stoms, and is very steep. Photos below are...1.) Slide Crown shots wrapping around the SOM shoulder. 2.) Debris pile 3.) SOM face with the involved groups' tracks on skiers right shoulder. It appears they skid down the shoulder to get to their slide trigger buddy. 4.)Obligatory powder shot in the face of som.

Possible it could have been remotely triggered from there or from below as folks riding up the canyon will sometimes carve up the lower part of the path.

As a result, chose a 30 degree slope for our exit run. First skier skied down to safe spot. Felt a minor collapse at the safe spot, and watched an adjacent, crossloaded, slope (which fed into a gully) slide. Seems to have run on the facets above the suncrust that we had been noting all day. However, when trying to examine the weak layer above the sun crust, couldn't see much more than broken particles with the occasional facet mixed in. Also, although I could not see any surface hoar, the way it triggered remotely was very much like surface hoar. Other west facing slopes on the other side of the gully cracked, but did not slide. Thinking that they did not have enough of a slab, and really needed more of a slab from wind load to slide.  Photos below.

They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.

Skier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.

We at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.","Not an obvious place for an avalanche other than slope steepness. It was 36 degrees at the steepest and transitioned to 34 degrees and even lower on the far side of the crown. While this is definitely avalanche terrain, from a skier's perspective it is not very steep and seemingly benign.","A ridge of high pressure with clear skies and cold nights last week created small facets and surface hoar on the snow surface. Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.

A weak storm system deposited 3-5"" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.","Photo of surface hoar crystals and the obvious stripe in the snowpit wall.  The blue card was inserted behind the layer to make it more visible for the photo, but it's easy to see in person. HOWEVER, this layer would be very difficult to find by digging with your hand. Using a shovel and making a clean pit wall makes it easy to see.

The snow profile below is from an E aspect.
","","","The first skier triggered this slide on his way to the trail head. The surface hoar layer was very obvious here as well. This slide was about 400 feet wide and ran only 100 feet. It nearly spans the width of the photo.

The crown averaged around a foot and a half, maybe 3 feet at the deepest tapering down on the flanks, and ran about 100ft on to lower angle terain, this intern triggered another pocket that popped out slid about five feet and stopped showing the staunch wall and the flanks clearly. I was also getting cracking on the ridge on my approach. Not sure if it would be categorize as hard slab or a soft slab but it wasn't like the light density sluffs and soft slabs of the last two days it was thick and inverted snow that wanted to drag you in with it. The wind was cranking on the ridge line and loading the lee aspect with dense wind blown snow, and it seemed to have released on lighter density snow from a few days ago.

Photos: the crown, the pocket that released sympathetically but only slid a few feet and cracking on the ridge line. Photos were tough the wind was blowing so much snow the crown was disappearing by the time I left.

The slide happened around 12:30 on our first lap. It slid in two different stages. Ed skied first and remotely triggered one pocket as he was skiing the final pitch above the trees. I skied second and skier's right of his track and remotely triggered the second pocket that broke higher and ran further out onto the face. It is hard to tell from the photos below, but the slide broke out a long way onto the face and I'm guessing the two pockets together are more than 300 feet wide. It is hard to tell just how long it ran, from our vantage point it ran below the trees and the staunchwall was not visible. There is a good chance it ran full track. The slope is north facing, I was not able to get a slope angle at the crown, but it broke at about the steepest part of the rollover. I measured 19 inches deep at the part of the crown I was able to get to, it looked deeper a little further out on the slope, maybe 24 inches at most. The slab consisted of the new snow that began falling Thursday afternoon. In the photos below you can clearly see two layers of snow comprising the slab. The bottom layer is the snow that fell Thursday into Friday morning and the top layer is the snow that started late Friday into today. Top layer is Fist density and the bottom layer is Fist Plus or maybe Four Finger Minus. This is a good example of how low density snow can still form a slab. The weak layer was a layer of Graupel between the bottom layer of the slab and the Bed Surface. There was a lot of graupel with the snow that fell Thursday into Friday. The bed surface was a thin crust that was very easy to break through. After our last storm the winds shifted and blew out of the NE, and I believe these winds are responsible for the thin crust that served as the bed surface. In my report yesterday I noted sensitive snow on this face as we walked the ridge line and experienced collapsing with loud whoomphs. We remotely triggered another part of the slope higher up the ridge on our second lap. As you are about to top out on the peak there is an island of trees on the ridge maybe 50 feet down off the peak. We walked out to the trees to look over the roll and remotely triggered another large pocket on the north face.

We noticed other recent activity while we were out today but not nearly what we expected after seeing the large destructive avalanches in virtually every canyon on the Wellsvilles.  Below is a list of other slides that we saw today:

Thurston Hollow:  We saw a large avalanche, approximately 1/3 mile wide at the crown. At the head of Thurston Hollow (a south fork of Hyde Park Canyon).  The crown encompassed most of the bowl on slopes facing WSW through NW at 8400 feet elevation.  We could not see the runout zone but the width of the crown was impressive. 

Steammill Peak:  A 100 wide foot pocket release mid slope on an east facing slope between Steam mill 2nd and 3rd Peak.  The pocket was at 8900 feet elevation.

State Line Bowl:  It looked like the Southern end of the bowl slid during the storm.  The slide was on an East facing slope around 8800 feet elevation

Tab Hollow:  A 400 foot wide avalanche was also notice on a northeast facing slope in Tab Hollow.  The crown was mid slope at an elevation of 8200 feet.  We could not see how far the slide ran

 

We found surprisingly stable conditions where we rode today.  We stayed on mostly east facing slopes between 8600 and 6500 feet.  We did not notice any collapsing or cracking of any kind.  There is a significant layer of rime on the ridgelines and surface hoar is grow in many areas.  We tested several steeper slopes by dropping 15-20 foot cliffs onto the slopes with no results.

The crown went from the eastern aspect and propagated across the slope to the north and around the corner to the north facing slope. It was unclear what triggered the slide but it looked like it was triggered on 01/15 before 8am and took out the skin track headed up the slope. There were many tracks on the face just north of the slide as well. I couldn't get a picture when I was out yesterday and did not get a good look at it to tell how deep it was.

After a morning of riding a few laps without any signs of instability, the group decided to push it a little higher in elevation and further to the south. When they got to their new location, they began to assess the slope. The group was divided in their feelings about the slope, particularly because it was a little steeper. With this in mind, they positioned a few riders in safe locations in case of an avalanche. 

One rider (it is unknown whether he was the first on the slope or not) decided to jump off a small cliff at the top of the hill. Upon landing, he triggered the avalanche, catching him and one other rider from the group. One of the riders suffered tibia and fibula fractures from hitting trees on the way down the slope, while the other rider was fully buried. Unfortunately, the rider who was fully buried had turned his beacon off earlier in the day because of low batteries. After the dust cleared, the other group members quickly realized that one person was buried. They desperately searched the avalanche debris, and were unable to find a transceiver signal. Eventually, they saw a board sticking out of the snow; the buried rider had decided to pow-surf the run, rather than snowboard. The group was able to use his leash to find him beneath the snow and dig him out quickly. The buried rider didn’t suffer any injuries.

The crew helped the injured rider down the mountain and into the snowcat, which immediately took off towards the trailhead. Around 5:00 pm, the snowcat was approximately 2.3 miles from the trailhead when it suddenly broke down. They had no cellphone service and could not get the snowcat working properly, so two members of the group ran 2.3 miles back to the Smith Moorehouse trailhead, got in their trucks, and drove to Kamas where they notified Search & Rescue. A medical helicopter was then dispatched and the injured rider was airlifted to the hospital. "," 

 The starting zone consists of a steep, rocky ridge, with a small hanging bowl that dumps into a once tightly treed runout. Image above is looking downslope from where the rider jumped off a small rock feature.


A closer look at the shallow snow that barely covered the small rock band where the slide was initially triggered.

This mid-slope breakover enabled the slide to quickly accelerate. In the distance you can clearly see two distinct layers in the avalanche. The first layer is the storm snow from the evening of Tuesday Jan. 17th which once initiated, broke deeper into the pack on a thin layer of small grained facets formed just before the New Year."," Wow... a truly remarkable amount of water weight was added to our snowpack. No matter how strong the existing pack was, even the slightest weakness will reveal its cards under this kind of load.




Wind data from nearby Windy Peak clearly shows the perfect pattern for creating a dense, cohesive, and well connected slab.","Avalanche danger for the day of the accident.

The crown looked to be around 4ft but the part of it by Cardiac pass was up to 6ft, it ran full track down to the flats and in a couple places almost to the sub ridge dividing Cardiff Fork. Of note it totally plastered the usual route up to Cardiac Bowl, the small treed ridge under Hansen's taking out small trees and burying the rest in hard debris. Not sure of the weak layer but the location of the crown tends to support that it pulled out on graupel that had rolled down from the cliffs and pooled then were buried buy the W-SW winds loading the E facing aspect, just my theory.

","","","A UDOT maintenance worker witnessed a natural avalanche at about 12:30 pm on Wednesday, January 11. It occurred directly across the highway from a popular parking lot for riders coming off the backside of Beaver Mountain (out of bounds). No one was caught in the slide. He immediately notified his crew and closed the highway. Paige Pagnucco (UAC and UDOT forecaster) responded from Beaver Mountain and traveled to the avalanche site to assess the situation. It was quickly determined that with forecast continued heavy snowfall and strong winds, the road would remain closed. UDOT, UHP and Beaver Mountain staff worked in cooperation to create a plan to get people safely down Logan Canyon.

Bill Nalli (UDOT avalanche supervisor) was notified immediately when the avalanche occurred and he traveled to Logan to help evaluate and mitigate the avalanche danger. Once the road was closed and cleared, UDOT mitigated determined areas of avalanche danger with explosives. The canyon re-opened the following morning with no further incident. 

Paige Pagnucco investigated the avalanche on 1/12/17 and found the weak layer to be small facets sitting just under a thick but brittle crust about 50 cm up from the ground. The area is very rocky underneath the bed surface and facets of various sizes exist. The trigger appears to be the intensified snowfall rate that occurred during that time. Combined with strong winds, the weight of the new snow overloaded the weak layer and caused it to fail . The avalanche occurred on the lee side of a small subridge. The height of the slab was 85-110 cm. 

Both lanes of the highway were covered with about 4-5' of debris for about 150'.

Forecaster notes:

Weather and Snow information:

From December 14 to December 16, the Alta Guard Station 3 miles NNE of the avalanche site, received snow containing 2.5 inches of snow water equivalent. On Thursday, December 15 and Friday, December 16 winds at 11,000 feet averaged 31 mph and gusted 47-62 mph from the southwest. By late Dec 16, winds at 11,000 feet were averaging 50 mph gusting to 75 mph from the WNW. Those winds were a significant factor in this avalanche for two reasons:

First, winds easily doubled the load on this slope with wind-blown snow adding significant stress to faceted snow at the ground. Faceted snow is very tricky. It can support a tremendous load without fracturing and producing an avalanche. However, as soon as a very small crack or failure is started, it can quickly fracture across the entire slope. The snowboarder who triggered this avalanche likely rode over a thin spot of the slab where he initiated a crack in the faceted snow layer which fractured and released the slab.

Second, winds built a slab that connected across both chutes. This stiff, cohesive slab is what helped carry the fracture across both chutes and fracture over such a wide area.

Snow that formed the weak layer in this avalanche fell in the fall and was preserved on this slope because of the high elevation and northerly aspect while snow melted off other slopes. This snow metamorphosed and became weak, faceted snow crystals. See the photo below from video footage taken on November 14, 2016. Notice that other aspects exposed to more sun did not have snow on the ground.

Avalanche information:

This party had been reading the avalanche advisory for most of the season. On the day of the avalanche, they had been looking for signs of instability during their tour in Mineral Basin, in Mary Ellen Gulch, over Silver Creek Peak, over American Fork Twin Peaks, and over Red Top Mountain. They noted warming on south aspects and were carefully monitoring wind speeds and direction. Winds were relatively light in the Birthday Chutes and not depositing snow at the time. Unfortunately it was winds on Thursday, December 15 and Friday, December 16 that heavily loaded this slope.

The image below (photo by M. White) shows the approximate location of the two people. One person was at the black X and was not caught in the avalanche. The person who was caught in this avalanche had traveled the path of the red line and was caught in the slide at the location of the red X. He initially made 3 or 4 turns, thought he heard something, began traversing to the looker’s right, and made 5 or 6 turns before the avalanche broke. He never saw the avalanche coming and said that it felt like he was hit by a freight train. The person on top of the ridge had to jump back to avoid being caught. He commented that the avalanche did not make any noise when it fractured and seemed to pull away very slowly for the first 50 feet before accelerating.

This avalanche was approximately 730 feet wide, 4-5 feet deep on average with a minimum of 3 feet and a maximum of 10 feet deep. It ran 1,100 feet vertical. U.S. classification is HS-AR-R3-D3-G



Rescue:

This avalanche occurred at about 5 p.m. Once the avalanche happened, this party was in a very difficult situation especially with the fading daylight. They both had radios with dead batteries from being on all day, thus they were not able to communicate. They could not see each other either. Both feared that the other had been caught and was buried.

The person on top of the ridge was unsure he could descend safely to his partner whom he thought was dead. Because of the late hour and what he thought was an unsafe situation, he decided to call 911. He was on top of the ridge for about an hour and a half in the dark. When his phone battery died, he finally descended a ridge and the White Pine drainage ultimately reaching the White Pine trailhead. The whole time he thought his partner was buried and dead. It wasn't until reaching the parking lot and talking with Search and Rescue personnel that he discovered his partner was alive.

The person caught in the avalanche survived and amazingly was not injured. When the avalanche stopped, he was on top of the debris only buried to his knees with his face down. As he looked up, he saw a powder cloud of airborne snow roll over top of him. Because he and his partner had not explicitly discussed a plan for riding this chute, he assumed the worst. Also, he was unable to communicate with his partner due to dead radio batteries and figured his partner was buried. He also contacted 911. For the next hour and a half he searched the debris field with an avalanche transceiver. Ultimately a helicopter was sent to the scene and transported him to Alta.

Forecaster comments:

On the day of the avalanche the danger was rated Moderate at this elevation. The avalanche problems listed in that day's advisory were Loose Dry avalanches, Loose Wet avalanches, and Storm Snow avalanches.

This was a difficult situation for all involved including Search and Rescue who received two separate calls from someone stating that their partner was buried in an avalanche. Sorting the details in these events can be very difficult. For the two people involved, it was also a very difficult and confusing situation as well. This event highlights how difficult avalanche rescue can be and that many events can happen at the end of the day in darkness. Luckily no one was buried. This emphasizes the need to practice companion rescue skills and be familiar with terrain because many avalanches occur under difficult conditions. If you are in unfamilar terrain, that can be an additional risk factor.

Deep slab avalanches are by far the most difficult avalanche problem to deal with. Even professional operations armed with explosives struggle with these types of avalanches. Because the weak layer is buried deeply under a thick, hard slab of snow, impacting the weak layer with enough force to trigger an avalanche is not easy to do. There’s a decent chance this party could have descended the chute without triggering this avalanche.

Information from this report comes from a visit to the avalanche by Mark Staples, Greg Gagne, Mark White and 2 members of the Snowbird Ski Patrol on December 20, 2016 as well as a phone interview with the two people involved in the avalanche. This report was compiled by Mark Staples with help from other UAC staff.

I had thought about driving up to Rochester Ridge yesterday but was concerned about the possibility of an avalanche even though it appeared that nothing had occurred yesterday (Sunday).  I noticed some ski tracks to the side of Big Daddy's and several snowmobile tracks today over the avalanche.  After I inspected the bottom part of the avalanche and made sure that I couldn't see any skiers or snowmobilers, I went up to Big Flat to take the photos.

An obvious large natural avalanche had occurred down the full length of the main, NE facing slope and had funneled into the choke point gully at the bottom. The slide ran all the way to the flat spot where most skiers exit the Dog Dish and Spire areas. Our guess was that the slide occurred at the start of or during the last big snowfall the weekend of the 16th and 17th because the avalanche debris was pretty well buried, though the biggest chunks (3' to 5') were protruding as if they were big boulders. There were no skis tracks down the Dog Dish run prior to ours.

We could just barely see the fracture line that was about 200' above where we entered Dog Dish at 9,600'. But, it appeared to be just below the NE to East facing cliff bands atop Dog Dish. Because of the distance to the fracture line and because it was well covered by the storm snow we could not estimate its depth. Whether or not it was triggered by a cornice fall is just a guess. We could not tell if it ran to the ground because of the deep covering of storm snow.

This avalanche's starting zone was a little less than 1 mile West of and about 1,000' lower than the Birthday Chutes slide that occurred on Monday the 19th. It was NE facing rather than NW facing. It ran close to the same length as the Birthday Chutes slide, but was much narrower due to the bowl and gullies that constricted it.","","",""

However , I was surprised how easily the slide was triggered and it certainly grabbed our attention. Sorry, no photos.

[FORECASTER COMMENT - We appreciate all observations, especially those that involve avalanches. I talked with the skier who reported this and they commented there were no other signs of instability today other than wind loading at the higher elevations. It sounds like a classic deep slab problem where they triggered the slide from a thinner area of the snowpack (the crown was 1' where it broke out near their skis as they made a hard cut to  the left, but quickly propagated above and behind them to a 3.5' crown) and the slide ran on a layer of facets at the ground. They reported the slide snapped some small trees at the bottom of the runout. Thanks again for the report.]

[A UAC forecaster was able to get a photo of the slide on 12/11/2016, the day after it occurred. Additional snowfall and winds filled in much of the visible avalanche path, but the outline of the crown is still visible, and is highlighted in this photo.]

 Going in, our main questions were: 
•	What layer did the snow fail on?  Was the storm snow failing on a weakness within, at the interface with thanksgiving snow, on leftover facets, or gliding on the rock itself?
•	Was this spot representative of high north aspects generally, or something special? 
The crown of the avalanche ranged in depth from as shallow as a foot (it was roughly that where the  skier tracks enter) to over 2' feet deep.  At the top of the slide and just above, the slope approaches 45 degrees.  And very much as Kliger described, the slide exposed rock below the snowpack—broad enough that it was hard to keep an edge on with skis and not worth trying in boots.  Perhaps more dramatic than the slide were the series of 2’ deep cracks on either side of the flanks.
Inspection of the flank and crown revealed 5-9mm facets at the base of an otherwise right-side-up snowpack.  The facets were sharp and dry, and failed on the 9th tap from the wrist on an ECT done in 50cm.  
Extended column tests performed to the west of the crown and just below the toe had similar profiles but important differences: Both were deeper (70cm), the facets were smaller (3-5cm) and we only got propagation along the facets with some heavy hitting “bonus” whacks at the end of the test.  
The absence of strong signs of instability so near to the avalanche, combined with tantalizing evidence of consequence-free steep skiing nearby, seems to support the forecast’s assessment that high elevation North aspect persistent slab problems are decidedly present, but perhaps trending from localized to isolated areas.

Went up to Alta today to take a look at Main Chute on Baldy. I've had good early season success skiing that there, so we skinned up to the top of Collins to scout it, and thinking it looked relatively filled in, decided to climb up to the top of Mt. Baldy for Main Chute via Sugarloaf Pass. At the top, there was obvious wind loading on the line, but the pillow of wind loaded snow looked relatively shallow, isolated and manageable. We did not see any other tracks around the area leading to the chute or apron, so I decided to drop in and do a ski cut. A soft storm/light wind slab pulled out at my feet ripping across the length of the chute 8 to 10 inches deep. It continued down the length of the line, propagating along the width of the chute on its way down. It started slowly, and looked like it would stop, so I was surprised to see it pick up steam on the way down. I knew there had been some wind loading, but I thought the ski cut would result in a more isolated pocket pulling out. The snowpack had a bit of an upside down feeling to it. We continued down the chute, and for the first few turns, the bed surface was consolated snow that was skiable. Then, halfway down, the bed surface became more sugary, unconsoladated snow and quite rocky. Perhaps we were overly optimistic about the amount and density of new snow in the Wasatch when we decided to drop into Main Chute this morning, but I felt able to manage the ski cut and the risk appropriately. It's always a good reminder to ensure that there is no one below you when you do a ski cut at a heavily trafficed area (we were certain that there was no one in the line when we dropped in, but Main Chute has a blind turn in the middle, so we couldn't see the apron and runout zone.) Also, a small avalanche has big consequences this time of year, with the capacity to cheese grater you over some sharky rocks, so take care. I suspect this wind slab/new storm snow will stabilize within 24 to 48 hours, but on the upper elevation north facing terrain, the old snow will continue to be a problem for awhile.

But, I skied a moderately steep East facing slope on a very warm day (45 degrees reported by NWS Top of Collins station at similar altitude and time of my accident), in mid afternoon, knowing there was a several inches deep new snowpack from last week's storm on top on the old consolidated base.

The starting slope angle of my run was moderate at only 25-30 degrees, but there was a crown where the hill angle broke at maybe 5 degrees steeper, and that's where the wet slab broke loose after my 2nd or 3rd turn made a ski cut across it. My next turn headed me right back into the sliding snow that I never detected until it pushed me downhill and into a sitting position. I rode the top of the sluffing snow and no part of me was covered by the debris.

We decided to do another ski cut, and we triggered a 6"" - 1' deep - 60' wide slide that ran down the elevator chute. Below the chute, it stepped into another layer and caused a good portion of the bowl to slide.

We also encountered two other smaller slides. One was on the east ridge of the same bowl and appeared to have broken all the way up on the ridgeline; it ran all the way into the bowl (3-400'?). The other was visible on a similar aspect ridge further west, also running down the west side of the ridge into a larger slide path.

I've skied a lot of north and east facing terrain over the last three days and been up on a number of normally wind-affected ridgelines and found no evidence of slabbing or instability, so this was a bit surprising to me. I think the east (southeast?) winds at the beginning of the storm crossloaded these sub-ridges and the gut of the bowl below Cougar setting up wind slabs that looked like they must've run sometime within the last two days.

Looked quite fresh at that point, I imagine it ran around dawn when winds seemed to spike from the SSE in LCC; particularly strong winds and drifting snow were observed driving up lower LCC around 615 AM. The slide appears to have run from near the very top of of the main branch of the chute, although debris in most other neighboring chutes suggests the tributary branches also avalanched. The debris looks like the slide may have started as a cold snow slide and gouged into rain-on-snow layering down low in the chute.

Snow conditions changed surprisingly quickly from dry and light around noon, to slightly damp and crumbly with a few, small roller balls on the first lap, to moderately cohesive with rollerballs running and growing on the second, to big naturals on the third. 

Under the storm snow on the west aspect there was a slightly noticeable crust on the upper third of the slope -- measuring from the ridge to the summer trail -- also a thin, but consistently noticeable crust in the middle third, and a firm crust in the bottom third. Apparently it rained in LCC on Monday. Maybe this was that or a melt/freeze crust? 

FIrst lap was all good. Great turns up top with stable snow. Middle third we cut above a few gullies, and it ran, but didn't gather or pull in other adjacent snow. We traversed out right to a skinner in sight from there and re-ascended. 

Second lap was more similar than different in the upper two thirds, although the snow had gotten thick, like ice cream. The bottom third was sketchy. Our cuts here flushed the snow we expected, but pulled in adjacent snow along the funnel-like terrain features. Shooting cracks occurred left, right and in some instances above where the cuts were made. Due to the thicker crust towards the bottom of the slope, all that snow picked up a bunch of energy and ran fast and far. The three in our group descended one at a time from tree to tree, or along the bed surface of a slide path until we were out of that zone. 

We bailed part way up the skinner for a third run over in Scotties Bowl, because we came across multiple slides, some completely natural with no tracks in sight, some big and wide debris piles, and we had no way to know if another party was above us to potentially bring a slide down on top of us. 

Danger seemed mainly Considerable with pockets of High, particularly at lower elevations where there was a pronounced crust and later in the afternoon when the storm snow had begun to bond. We even got lots of cracks and slabs of storm snow to flush through the trees in the runout above the bridge at around 8500 feet. 

Today was a day to expect some danger, pay attention for it, and make conservative decisions. We hope that everyone who went out in the backcountry today came back.

First was skiers right of the main hideaway gullies. A couple of ski turns on the mellow section high above a convex rollover was all it took to propagate a crack and trigger a new snow avalanche several yards downslope. Two adjacent paths sympathetically released resulting in a larger avalanche which crossed and covered a large section of the skin track below. The low density snow would have been hard pressed to knock even an unaware skier off their feet, yet once all of the snow had channeled into the gully, it would have been an unpleasant experience to be a part of.
Second was in Main Days. A ski cut on a rollover mid slope in the main gully produced a new snow slide which propagated out about 8"" deep and 40' wide. Two other identical slides were noted. One likely human triggered at the bottom steeps and one potentially natural breaking off a steep roll just below the ridge and covering several ski tracks at the transition below.

On my second ski cut I triggered a storm slab that propagated 10-15 ft uphill (about halfway between the ridge and I), and about 300 ft laterally.  The avalanche ran 500-600 ft. to the beginning of the ""half pipe"" portion of the Main Days slide path.

Most likely attributable to the awesomely high PI rates out there today and possibly some very minor wind loading on northerly aspects.  Served as a good reminder to stay assertive while dealing with new snow instability.

After a great run on Bonkers we continued up the skin track into the upper reaches of Broads Fork.  My partner and myself had mentioned the possibility of a glide avalanche coming down off of blue ice and the diving board and agreed that spacing would be important on the skin across the bottom. A group of skiers who had ascended earlier in the day were heading down as we were heading up the skin track and they skied the slope bellow blue ice quickly as well. After crossing the tree patch and continuing on to the roll over that constitutes the upper basin of Broads Fork I looked back and saw that a glide avalanche had broken loose and covered the skin track and the skier tracks under blue ice. I was able to see large blocks still tumbling and the debris settling into the slope we had just crossed. This is one of those experiences that has been best described as we got away with one. Though glide avalanches may be harder to predict, rapid warming on steep smooth rock and the time of day should have played more of a factor in the decision making. Both my partner and I consider ourselves fortunate to be able to sit here and drink a beer while writing this report today. We get to take a pebble from the luck jar and put it in the experience jar.

""What I do know is that there was a 41 y.o. male, his brother, and his 15 y.o. son that left the Dry Canyon trailhead approx. 1 a.m. Fri. to attempt a summit bid of Timp via the Everest Ridge.  The group appeared fit, prepared (proper clothing, mountaineering boots, crampons, ice axes, but did not have beacons and avalanche gear) and was at least somewhat experienced with mountaineering and snow climbing.  Somewhere around 10,000' +/- on the ridge they turned back as there were very strong winds.   On the way down the 41 y.o. male victim was glissading and triggered a shallow wind slab that carried him over a couple of small cliff bands and some distance down the mountain.  He
 was fully buried, but shallow enough to dig at least his torso out and full escape the debris with the assistance of his brother and son.  The other 2 climbers were not caught in the slide.  The victim, who was wearing a helmet did hit his head, had no apparent head injuries, but had an obvious lower leg fracture.  His brother and son assisted him down the gully east of the ridge to an elevation approximately even with the Baldy Saddle (8,500'). The Everest Ridge has a SSW aspect, but it is unclear to me if they were on the ridge itself or to the east when the avalanche occurred.  The brother of the victim then went down the mountain to get help.  Our team was dispatched around 9:30 a.m. and were shuttled to the saddle by LifeFlight, treated the victim, moved him approximately 1/4 mi. to the helicopter and he was transported to Ut Valley hospital by LifeFlight.""

""A wind slab appears to have been instrumental in a mountaineer getting carried over a few small cliff bands while glissading. He was buried shallowly enough that he was able to get himself partly out, then the rest of the way with help from his climbing party, who did a great job until SAR and Life Flight arrived to bring him the rest of the way down the mountain. I strongly suspect that he wouldn't have been injured if he wasn't glissading with crampons on. 
PLEASE DO NOT GLISSADE WITH CRAMPONS ON! Many people have told me that they simply keep their heels up and are perfectly safe, but I've also carried multiple people off the mountain who snap their tib/fibs when the crampons catch for a variety of reasons. (Micro spikes are probably fine.)""

 

Forecaster note:  A wind slab is probably a good guess.  This also sounds like an example of where even a small slide can have serious consequences in more radical terrain - where you could go off cliffs or into trees.  Basic avalanche gear - a beacon, shovel and probe - should be carried by each person recreating in avalanche terrain - snow covered mountains.

The party did a great job in completing the rescue, getting the injured person to a good spot and then going for help.

Forecaster comments:

Avalanche was almost identical to the accident that occurred there on March 9, right down to the weather conditions prior. On Tuesday, March 22, the mountains received 6-10"" of new snow accompanied by moderate winds that shifted from SW to NW. The new snow drifted into the gully on top of the bed surface/remaining facets from the slide of March 9. Two skiers descended the upper slopes without incident and regrouped at the top of the steep convexity. Apparently opting not to descend into the gully, tracks indicate that they made a ski cut across the top releasing the pocket at a slightly higher elevation than the earlier slide. Second skier then followed across and they descended a lower angle, tree covered slope. 

This avalanche path has been very active this season, releasing twice naturally. On December 26, it fractured 6-7' deep and ran full track, or approximately 3000' taking out small trees going up the bank on the far side, and rounding the corner into the main drainage of Gold Basin.

Observed instabilities within new snow about 6"" down pretty much everywhere we skinned/skied, but the slab on top was not terribly cohesive, so propagation was fairly minimal.

The windloading and cracking in the spot that slid were obvious, and my partner was fairly certain it would slide before he triggered it. We saw a similar slide lower down on the skin track, set by a previous party, though it was on a less steep slope, maybe 34 deg., and didn't run far.  Winds were gusty at times, more so at the upper elevations, but we observed sporadic gusts as low as the road. 
Despite gusts, the surface snow was still fairly loose, not too slabby, though it could be worse on other aspects (we were on predominantly north).  Also felt that new snow was fairly well bonded to old surfaces, even on terrain features that oriented off of north and thus had crusts underneath.","","",""

"3/19/2016","Salt Lake","Superior","Skier","Wet grains","","","","South","","","","","","","","","","","","Hi  UAC.  I have been following you since the mid ninety's.  I read your report daily and get in the backcountry between 4-8 times a year.  I often play it safe - waiting for a couple days after the storm, choose slope angles and aspects according to your forecast.  Well yesterday I got a big surprise.  

My route was from Hellgate Condos to Suicide Chute on Superior.  I got to the Trail Head at 12:00.  I know a late start - but the last time I was in Suicide in the springtime was the 2010 big snow year.  Then I needed, but didn't have crampons.  Because the conditions in suicide were FIRM.  Like barely get your toe into the snow kinda hiking.  I had started out early that trip and waited at the top for the snow to soften - which it never did.  

Well anyrate, this time I had crampons - but needed to do a TH adjustment to my new boots.  So that took a little time.  Then I organized my stuff - talked to a guest and was on my way skinning.  I am not sure what time I left the lot.  The skin was pretty straight forward.  Just an uphill traverse across a bunch of small trees all bent over till I got on the apron.  Then I was switchbacking up to the place I remember as the booter.  As I was skinning I saw evidence of past avalanches.  The day earlier it seemed - which were all point releases from a skier or a snowboarder traversing above rocky areas.  While I was skinning I also was happy with the amount I was pushing down into the snow.  I was barely getting through.  most of the time I was only into the snow a CM or so.  Barely above the thickness of my skis.  I did not see roller balls nor was I slogging in damp snow.  

I made it to the booter and was transitioning from skins to boot.  I had just put on my pack and was downing the last of a liter of water when I heard first a rumble.  Then I say what was coming around the corner and I high tailed it to the base of a rockband for a safety.  It was loud but a slow moving wet slide.  Ok  I thought - I got lucky and it was time to jet down the apron.  I took some pictures and put my skis on and skied down the apron.  The debris pile was enough to bury a person.  

When I got to the road - Kevin Payne - the Alta town marshall was finishing writing up a ticket for another motorist.  I skied down to the road and asked him if he saw that.  He did.  His response was that 2 skiers above the choke kicked of the slide.  I am sure they would not been able to see me since I was under a cliff band and not in the chute.  He had eyes on me.  Watched me ski the apron wand wanted to talk to me.  

At that point I was just operating on adrenaline still.  Thoughts that went through my head were -  that was a close call.  I almost got snuffed by a natural.  That is what I thought at least.  I read the report - I pay attention to the conditions - I have turned around before not wanting to risk to much.  All the right things.   Only until I saw the skiers picking their way through the avy debris that I knew what the trigger was.  

Well that was a close one.  If I had been in the chute leading up to suicide I would not have been quick enough to avoid the slow moving slide.  

I know I did some things wrong also.  Like tending to errands before skiing on Sat.  which delayed my start time by a couple of hours.  
Stopping to take pictures of the Heli buzzing me 3 times as it was ferrying skiers over Superior.  Also I transition slowly.  Which in this case was a good thing.  It prevented me from being exposed in the choke of the chute with all that snow coming down.  

I was talking to Kevin Payne at 2:00 so the slide must have happened 5-10 minutes earlier.  The amount of time to take pictures - put on my skis and ski the apron. 

Humbly yours

One person sustained an ankle injury.  It is unknown whether or not they saw the avalanche from the day before.

Both avalanches failed on the same weak layer (graupel and facets from Saturday 3/12/16) and ran the same vertical distance, but (B) was about 3-4x as wide.

The slope is very steep at the top (42-44 degrees) but quickly tapers so the slab did not have a chance to run far.

We did not receive much information as to whether or not either party had read the advisory each day nor do we know their decision making process or level of avalanche education. Both parties did appear to have proper avalanche rescue equipment.

In one of the pictures, a sled ski track is visible on the bed surface near the crown. This could be the ski of the sled that actually triggered the avalanche though with four snowmobiles on the slope at the same time it is hard to pinpoint the exact placement of the trigger.

The wind was blowing all day and cross loading the right side corner pocket, once we got to where we were going to ski the slope looked wind loaded and slabbed up, decided to drop a cornice, with no one in the area of course. The decent size cornice dropped and triggered a fairly large hard slab avalanche which propagated to about 150ft wide and left a crown that was 3ft at the deepest and averaged around 20 inches deep, the slide spread out a bit and ran full track to the flats at the bottom leaving refrigerator sized chunks of hard slab and cornice at the bottom of the path, far from a user friendly slide. The slide steeped down about 40ft down the slope, not quite sure if it went into old snow but it seems highly likely if you look at the photo of where it stepped down. The weak layer was lighter density snow under the hard wind slab, it was hard to tell if it did step into old snow because the wind was filling the bed surface in so fast with newly transported snow. The debris pile at the bottom was easily 10ft deep and would have certainly buried a person caught in it.

Both avalanches had the same weak layer (graupel and facets) as well as steep slope angle (42-44 degrees at the crown) though this one was quite a bit narrower (80' across). The entire slope faces east and was loaded heavily by the westerly winds during the week's storm.

Looking at the crown revealed that it slid on facets that formed under the crust from last Sundays small storm, and took the crust with it. There were also crowns on the roll over that revealed graupel that remained intact under the old heat crust. The slide pulled out in the upper chutes and propagated out wider on the main slope, then broke into the old crust on the roll over and got a bit wider. The avalanche ran about a thousand feet and left a deep debris pile at the bottom. Thinking wind loading was the culprit, the NE chutes were being cross loade by the strong NW winds.

According to my partner, the slab broke about 20 feet above me though it was definitely a soft wind slab.  Due to intuition/luck I felt like I should cut back hard to my left on that second turn and had enough momentum to ski off the slab into some trees.  What we had thought were just some fun looking isolated wind pillows turned out to be a cohesive wind slab.  It was also interesting that the slide broke on the old snow interface rather than on one of the weak layers in the north facing snowpack right now.  Slab was between about 10-18 inches thick depending on location.  Even though it was a relatively small slide, my first (and hopefully last) ride on an avalanche was a good reminder of the constant respect the mountains require and to more carefully evaluate wind affected terrain.

I tried to ski off to the side and missed the brunt, but I discovered it is difficult to ski to the side when the slope is moving downhill.  I ended up mostly covered with snow, but I wouldn't say I was buried.  I did lose my prescription sunglasses and was very lucky and grateful to find them. 

I did not measure the slope angle so 40 degrees is an estimate.  I did not inspect the bed surface, although I am reasonably confident is was the new snow-old snow interface.  The 5 turns I made at the bottom of the little avalanche were soft, and creamy.  Slabs are difficult to identify.

As I watched people ski the days headwall, which had more snow, I wondered how different the conditions were on those aspects compared to what slid on me.  I think not much.

Around 2:00 p.m. a group of four skiers descended the the NE face of Tukno, a 1700 foot run with steep chutes at the top, a lower angle bowl in the middle, and a very steep convex roll into a gully near the bottom. Conscious of wind slabs that had formed three days prior, the group dug in the snow and performed a ski cut at the top of the chutes which produced a loose, long running sluff.

The party skied the upper chutes and bowl, and then regrouped on top of the steep, complicated convexity that fell into the gully. The first member of the party worked down the the steep NE flank of the gully before dropping in through some rocks. He made a couple turns before the slab fractured and he was swept over rocks and carried 200' through the gully. The debris fanned out and stopped on a lower angle apron. 

About 2:30 p.m. I received a text  from the injured skier who said he had been swept over a cliff, had a broken patella, and needed to be evacuated. He was a local skier who had sent in observations over the winter. I had met him about a month prior and gotten his phone number. 

I notified GCSAR and we assembled a hasty team of 4 members including myself. We mobilized to the Geyser Pass trailhead, and the hasty team snowmobiled to the end of the road in Gold Basin and then began skinning in. Within a quarter mile we encountered the party coming out in what turns out to be an amazing self rescue with the assistance of another group. 

The Moab Winter Search and Rescue team maintains a sled just above treeline on Laurel Ridge which is across the basin from where the accident occurred. In a stroke of luck, a party from Winter Park, CO saw the avalanche occur and they happened to be standing right next to the sled. A snowboarder in the party grabbed the sled, descended a 1400' run known as the Funnel, and then he and his group dragged  it up to the accident site. 

Meanwhile, the accident party had performed first aid and fashioned a sled from skis to get the victim down to lower angle terrain. The group then hauled the victim out in the sled until we encountered them. We hauled the sled about a quarter mile to the end of the Gold Basin Road, where GCSAR had staged a UHV with tracks to haul the victim the rest of the way out to the parking lot at the trailhead. The patient was transferred to a 4wd ambulance and ultimately transported to a hospital in Grand Junction. ","The NE face of Tukno is a 1700' run with steep chutes at the top, a lower angle bowl of around 30 degrees in the middle, followed by a steep gully that terminates on a low angle apron. Complicated convexities surround the entrance into the gully and the area is rocky and steep with slope angles varying between 40 and 45 degrees where the slide was initiated. ","On the day of the accident, skies were clear and temperatures were in the mid 30's at 10,000'. Winds were light from the NE. 6-8"" of medium density snow, accompanied by moderate SW winds had fallen two days prior. 

By the end of January, the La Sals had seen an exceptional winter with regular storms and a snowpack at around 175% of normal. Average base depth was 70"" and the snowpack was generally very strong. A significant storm over Christmas produced a wide spread avalanche cycle. The NE face of Tukno fractured 6' deep to the ground and ran full track. January storms continued to pile on snow and on February 1, a 16"" storm again caused an avalanche on the NE face of Tukno. 

February saw dry and unseasonably warm temperatures, as well as a fair amount of wind that scoured much of the highest exposed terrain. Other than the storm on Feb 1, the rest of the month was dry but for 6""  that fell on Feb 22. Spring conditions were in full effect with stout melt freeze crusts and corn snow on SE-S-W aspects. The snowpack was mostly stable and people were getting everywhere; climbing peaks, skiing and high marking on steep, upper elevation northerly facing terrain without incident.

High pressure and unseasonably warm temperatures continued to dominate the region until a storm on March 6-7 produced 6-8"" of medium density snow accompanied by moderate southwest winds. Natural loose snow sluffing occurred during the storm on northerly aspects over about 40 degrees. During field work on March 7, I observed wind slabs up to 18"" deep along the lee sides of upper elevation ridge crests and terrain features. They weren't very reactive but I felt they were worth mentioning in the next day's advisory. 

 ","The snow in this steep and rocky area is very shallow due to the repeat running nature of the slide path this season. This isolated pocket seems to be very much the exception, rather than the rule for the overall snowpack. Rocks, complex terrain features, and the terrain trap nature of the gully all contributed to the severity of this accident.

Based on the lack of new snow on top of the debris, it appears the slide occurred near the end of the last storm Monday night February 22nd.

This snowmobile triggered slide occurred at approximately 1200 moments before we arrived. The crown depth ranged from 2 feet to 6 feet where it was wind loaded near the cornices. On the edges of the flank below the ridge a little bit, snowpack depth was 3.2 feet which is very shallow. This path likely ran in late December based on this shallow snowpack depth.

The rider had climbed through a clearing in the trees to the lookers left of the path. Near the ridge top he sidehilled to the west in order to descend an open area. There were a few rocks poking through the snow (evidence of a thin snowpack) and he slowed down a bit. Then he saw the slope fracture. He instantly deployed his air bag back pack then turned down hill and tried to escape the avalanche.

He feathered/pumped the throttle attempting to get off the slab but it kept fracturing in front of him. About 1/3-1/2 way down the slope, he began rising up what felt like 10 feet in the air. He was afraid that his sled would then nose dive, so he hit the throttle to keep the nose of his sled up and maintain control of the sled. As he move further down slope with the avalanche, he was engulfed in the powder cloud and couldn't see anything. He pinned the throttle again and shot out of the powder cloud and ahead of the avalanche debris.

He and his two partners all carried avalanche rescue gear (avalanche beacons, shovels, probes and air bag back packs). His partners were in a safe location when the avalanche occurred. They had attended a recent avalanche awareness talk given by the Utah Avalanche Center forecaster assigned to this zone. Additionally they had read the advisory for the day and remembered the danger being mostly LOW with a few areas that included slopes like this one as being MODERATE.

Air bag comments: It is remarkable that this rider was able to inflate his air bag AND maintain control of his sled to escape the avalanche. Many other riders have time to do one or the other. Additionally he was wearing the type of air bag that inflates around the head, neck and shoulders (presumably to prevent trauma to the head and neck). He reported that his focus was down hill in front of the sled, and the air bag did not in any way block his vision.

We did an ECT in the pit in the background behind the sled. It fractured and propagated at 23 taps (3 from the shoulder), ECTP23.  I'm not sure if this slope avalanched previously or was scoured by the wind. A previous avalanche seems more likely.

FORECASTER NOTE:  Numerous avalanches have occurred in Jolly's Hole this season.  There is a good chance that this avalanche slope has also avalanched earlier in the season.  Slopes that have already avalanched this season continue to be quite likely to avalanche again.  However, it is very difficult to determine whether a slope has avalanched earlier this season by just looking at it.  You really need to pay close attention to a particular slope all through the season to know it's history.  This makes things very tricky out there still.  Brett Kobernik

The slab failed on the facets above the crust, and was confined to the area that had been exposed to the sun. The snow was stable on slopes without a crust. Conservative skiing and maximum awareness of the terrain around me prevented a nasty ride through the trees and into a gully. ","","",""

I was planning field work on the day of the incident and went to do our procedural “check out” where we document our field work plan.  My phone wouldn’t connect to the internet for some reason, so I called the Forecaster on Duty, Evelyn, and spoke with her directly to inform her of my intentions.  A recent storm had moved through on January 31st.  The wind had blown from the southwest then switched to the southeast in the 30 mph range during the storm.  The wind blew from the northwest in the 25 mph range for a number of hours on February 1st.  The skies were clear with light north wind in the 10 to 15 mph range on the day of the incident

I met a friend and his wife who were planning on skiing on the Manti Skyline.  We met at the Miller Flat parking lot around noon to decide where to go.  I suggested that we go into Huntington Canyon for a couple of reasons.


	The storm that had just moved through had a southeast flow and I was interested to see if Huntington Canyon had been favored with snow from the orographic effect.
	
	
	It was a late start and it would be easy for us to walk on skis directly from the road rather than travel on sleds as I often do on the Skyline.
	
	
	There are many safe, low angle gladed slopes for fieldwork and skiing.
	
In Huntington Canyon we selected a slope with a steepness of 25 to 30 degrees and no exposure to avalanche hazard.  We agreed to ascend the 1000 foot glade and descend the same route.  I found less new snow than anticipated.  I had heard reports of up to 14” of new snow.  I found an average of 6”.

As we ascended, we noticed that the snow surface was wind affected on the upper third of the slope.  Also as we were ascending, I was doing my usual sniffing around in the snow which included poking it with my pole to feel the layering, doing quick hand pits to investigate the new snow, and digging through the entire snowpack for more detailed observations.  The snowpack structure was as I expected.  It consisted of 8 to 10 inches of well developed faceted snow with 1 to 2 feet of more consolidated snow on top of it.  My shear and propagation tests produced no alarming results.  A compression test results showed a Q2 shear after 10 to 15 taps.  Extended column tests yielded no propagation in the weak snow near the ground.

Since November, I have been monitoring the snowpack in this area which is more shallow than other parts of the Manti-Skyline.  The snowpack seems to always be very weak but rarely gets overloaded by large amounts of new snow.  Huntington Canyon is on the lee side of the range which doesn’t receive as much snow, and avalanche events are infrequent.

At the top of the slope, we discussed our descent.  My friend’s wife is not a strong skier and descending the wind affected snow of our ascent route was going to be difficult.  Vegetation sticking through the snow would add to the difficulty.  We decided to look for an alternate descent route with easier skiing and less vegetation.

The alternative was unfamiliar, steeper terrain adjacent to our ascent route.  This terrain is steeper and capable of producing avalanches but I thought that we would be able to find a route that avoided the steepest parts of the slope.

The slope starts out relatively flat, steepens mid slope, then lessens in angle further down slope.  This convex shape prevented us from seeing the entire slope from the top. Each person would ski through the steeper mid slope section and regroup in a safe zone below the steep portion.  We could all see the safe zone from the top.

I skied first and found about 6” of new snow that was not wind affected.  It was easy skiing at the top.  As I descended, the terrain became steeper than I anticipated and made me nervous.  Also, the new snow became thicker, indicating wind effect.  This thick snow made me nervous because wind affected snow is more likely to avalanche than non-wind affected snow. Because the slope was steeper and more wind affected than anticipated,  I slowed and looked  for an alternative descent.  There were no alternatives.  In a split second decision, I decided to  rapidly descend 200 or 300 feet of steeper terrain into the safe zone below and left of my current position.  Before I could act, the slope fractured.

Knowing I triggered an avalanche, I lunged for a tree, but missed it by inches.  I fell on my side on top of the slab as it started sliding downhill.  It started slow and I had time to think but I was unable to do anything.  As it gained speed and started to break apart, I was submerged under the debris.  At this time my skis were still on my feet and were pulling me down.  I kicked my feet hard against each other and the skis released.  I started to swim in the debris and surprisingly found myself briefly on the surface. A second wave of debris pushed me under the snow again.   This wave felt much heavier than the first and I felt the speed increase.  I was frightened, thinking that a massive amount of snow had released above me and I was going to be buried very deep.  I kept struggling and trying to swim.  It felt futile but I kept fighting.  I was under the snow with a lot of pressure on my body when I felt the debris slowing down.  I continued fighting and suddenly felt the pressure decrease until I surfaced at the toe of the debris.

I brushed snow off of my body, pulled my feet out of the debris and stood up.  My friend descended the track of the avalanche with his avalanche transceiver in receive mode.  When he reached me, we moved off the track of the avalanche path.  I lost my skis and poles.  The toe of the debris was only about 200 yards from our trucks.  I walked through the snow on my own although I had a dislocated shoulder and substantial knee damage.

We went to the Intermountain Healthcare medical clinic in Mount Pleasant where medical staff took  x-rays of my right  shoulder and reduced the dislocation.  A few days later, the University of Utah Orthopedic Clinic examined my right knee which had a damaged MCL ligament and a completely torn ACL ligament.

SNOWPACK AND AVALANCHE

The avalanche broke 16 to 20 inches deep on weak faceted snow near the ground.  The “thicker snow” may have played a role in this slope being more sensitive due to recent wind effect which made the snow more cohesive.  However, it is possible that the slope may have released even without any wind affected snow.  The initial slab was about 100 feet wide.  As the avalanche descended, other parts of the slope released, which may have caused the “second wave” of debris.  The avalanche descended about 600 vertical feet. The slope faces east northeast  approximately 37 and 40 degrees in slope steepness.

After reviewing photos from earlier in the winter during a natural avalanche cycle, I realized that this slope had avalanched on December 22nd.

LESSONS LEARNED

In hindsight, there are several contributing factors to this accident.  I let my guard down about the condition of the snowpack for a number of reasons.


	There was much less snow from the previous storm than I anticipated
	
	
	There were no surprises in the snowpack structure.  It contained plenty of weak snow but I concluded there was not enough of a new load to create unstable conditions
	
	
	When we changed our initial plan to descend the low angle, ascent slope, we did not fully discuss what we might anticipate in terms of stability on the other slope.  
	
	
	We chose to descend unfamiliar terrain and grossly underestimated the extent of the steepness across that slope.  I assumed we would find a route through that was either low angle or would only have a short steeper section.
	
	
	I underestimated the wind effect across the mid portion of the slope
	
	
	I did not remember that the slope had already avalanched this season.
	
THINGS DONE WELL

Standard procedures were followed, including: checking out with the Forecaster on Duty, using a low angle ascent route, descending one at a time, performing normal snowpack observations and stability tests. Additionally, we chose a location where we wouldn’t be rushed due to our late start.

FINAL COMMENTS

It is always easy to see mistakes in hindsight and have the illusion that we will never make the same mistakes.  After over 10 years of professionally assessing avalanche involvements and accidents, I have learned that simple mistakes can lead to major accidents. Diligent adherence to the Utah Avalanche Center’s operational safety procedures is the best method to prevent similar accidents.  When our group decided to deviate from the original plan, a more thorough re-evaluation of our intentions with input from all of the group members most likely would have deterred us from choosing to descend that slope.","","As stated in the summary above, the snowpack consisted of faceted snow near the ground which formed in November and early December.  There was 1 to 2 feet of more consolidated snow which acted as the slab.  This snow was from the stormy period in late December and January.  This was one of the last avalanches that broke into the early season faceted snow.","Initial report below:


I triggered and was caught in an avalanche today. Very close call. Triggered at a mid slope break over. Missed grabbing a tree as it fractured, dragged in, tumbled being fully submerged at times, swam for my life, wound up partially buried, uncovered myself before partners got to me. Walked out 200 yards to the road. Tweaked knee, dislocated shoulder, badly injured ego. All on the mend now, more details to follow.  Slope was one we did not originally intend to descend.

(Edited size of avalanche.  Size of slide overestimated at the time of the incident.  UAC and UDOT staff visited the site and confirmed depth to be 16 to 20"" deep by 100 feet wide.  We will publish entire report but not before a public discussion during a ""FIRESIDE CHAT"" AT BLACK DIAMOND, TUESDAY, FEB 9, 7PM)

","","","From Erik Syrstad 2-2-16 (Thanks):

I think you are correct about timing.  When I skied this shot on Sunday evening (from the trees on the left side of the photo, just after sunset), it was dead calm up there and no active wind loading was observed.  The Ogden Peak station shows an east wind kicking up starting around 630-7 pm that night.

This is definitely a repeater.  Pretty much all the big slide paths in the Logan Peak area and front canyons slid somewhere during or after the Christmas cycle.  At one point almost everything I was skiing was a filled in bed surface including this one.  However this one may have either gone twice, or not until later, with a smaller slide after New Year (maybe from that east wind event).  On Jan. 9 it was basically dust on crust, with ~8” of beautiful snow on top of a hard bed surface, and lots of debris ~500’ below the ridge that was partially covered.  Mogul run.

During the search, a member of the public notified Search and Rescue that they had seen Jones along the Park City/Mill Creek Ridgeline at 4 p.m. on Sunday above a slope called “Home Run”. Just north of “Home Run”, an avalanche was spotted on a treed slope along Rip’s Ridge just west of a slope called “Shale Shot”. A few other members of the public, who had seen Jones on Sunday, provided information that narrowed the search to this area.

On Tuesday, explosives were used to reduce avalanche hazard so rescuers could safely search the debris. Slopes in an east facing bowl with runs called Pointy Peak and Sound of Music and slopes adjacent to the avalanche were tested with explosives. Small new snow avalanches released in the east facing bowl; otherwise, explosive work did not trigger any other slides.

The area had been searched with a helicopter mounted RECCO detector and a search antenna that detects a transmitting avalanche beacon. No signals were detected, but tall trees prevented the helicopters from getting close to the debris. After explosive work was completed, ground teams searched the original avalanche debris with avalanche beacons. A searcher using a Pieps DSP detected a faint signal from Jones’ beacon (another Pieps DSP reported to be 10-15 years old). The initial distance reading was 26 meters. They discovered Jones Tuesday afternoon at approximately 1:50 p.m. He was buried about 2 feet deep with telemark skis still attached to his boots and poles attached with wrist straps.

The Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable on January 31, 2016. See danger rose and Bottom Line below from that day’s advisory.



“The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper and mid elevation slopes, where new snow soft slabs in wind drifted terrain and sluffs can be triggered on slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper. If the winds increase where you are today, the danger will increase rapidly. There is a CONSIDERABLE danger on steep, upper elevation slopes were deep slides breaking near the ground can be triggered.”

The full advisory from that day can be found HERE","This north facing slope at an elevation of 9100 feet is not an obvious avalanche path because it is mostly tree covered. There is a small clearing where the avalanche released at 36 degrees in steepness which quickly steepens to 39 degrees. From a skier’s perspective this is a small seemingly benign slope unfortunately it is steep and open enough to produce an avalanche.","The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.

Weather events became even more complex in January with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th with warm sunny days and clear cold nights developed near surface facets on shady slopes and ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.

Between January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle.

A weekend storm January 30th and 31st resulted in about 12"" of snow, and 1.25 inches of snow water equivalent along the Park City ridge line by Sunday morning, January 31st.","This report contains information gathered by Utah Avalanche Center staff member Mark Staples who interviewed SAR members and from a site visit on Wednesday, February 3, 2016.

He was found injured after being hung up in a small set of trees whereupon the guides quickly responded to locate, assess, and evacuate him via helicopter to a hospital in Salt Lake City.  He ultimately sustained ankle, multiple rib injuries and a small pneumothorax injury in the lungs. 

This was the second group to have skiied this terrain for the day and he was the 15th skier to ski the slope before it avalanched.  It appeared that he was 200' down the slope when he took a hard ""tomahawk-style"" fall, collapsing the slab onto the facets below, propagating well above him to the rocks.  ","Holy Toledo is a steep northwest facing slope in upper Cardiff Fork of Big Cottonwood Canyon.  Slope angles varied from 39-42 degrees.  The starting zone was at 10,300'. ","The weather has been complex this winter.  November’s early season snow was followed by a long, mostly dry spell, with only very small, intermittent snow storms, for much of November and early December.  During this time, periodic cold temperatures and clear skies contributed to the faceting of the shallow snowpack on the shady slopes. In November and December there were also several warm, sunny periods that led to the formation of crusts on the sunny slopes.  A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack, and culminated with a major avalanche cycle.

Weather events became even more complex in January.  The New Year was ushered in with a very strong southeasterly wind event on January 1st, scouring and loading unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle.  This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th.   A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with clear skies, allowed for the development of near surface facets on the shady slopes, with sunny skies and warm temperatures leading to more sun crusts on the solar aspects.  

Between January 14th and 20th, a series of storms brought snow six out of seven days.  This period was culminated with a very stormy day on the January 20th, with periods of very strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and a very active avalanche cycle.  Snow stations in upper Little Cottonwood recorded roughly 2' of snow and 2"" of SWE from the afternoon of Jan 23rd through Jan 25th.  Strong winds from the northwest blew during the evening of January 24th. Dawn broke with clear skies on the morning of the accident, Jan 26.  ","photos Mark White; video Drew Hardesty

","Addition from Tues, Jan 26.

Went to look at this slide. Dug a few pits along the way and dug a pit near the avalanche in a low angle slope where I'd dig to assess the stability of this slope as if it hadn't avalanched.

The scary part is that there are no other signs of instability. Looking at the snow in pits isn't scary either. The snowpack looks pretty strong. ECT's seem to produce ECTN's in the storm layers, and ECTX's in the lower faceted layers. I got one ECTP28 in my pit on a slope adjacent to this slide.

What to do? Stay off anything steep at upper elevations on all aspects. Probably mid elevations too. There is great coverage and great riding on low angle slopes (ones less than 30 degrees in steepness) on the north half of the compass.

They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.

Bradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”

After the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.

Bradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.

Bradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.

After extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.

Green was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.

The enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.

The Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.



“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”

The full advisory from that day can be found at:

https://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016

 ","The Whitesnake avalanche path just below the west summit of Gobbler's Knob at 10,246' has a steep starting zone that funnels into a narrow, rocky gully. The starting zone aspects ran from 107 degrees ESE to 215 degrees SSW. The upper starting zone was cross-loaded from strong west to northwest winds in the late evening of January 19 into January 20. Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees. Two adjacent slopes avalanched naturally several days later on January 24 and January 27.","The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.

Weather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.

Between January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11"" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65"" to 1.04"". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.

January 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.","","Information in this report was gathered by Utah Avalanche Center (UAC) staff Mark Staples from an interview with Tyson Bradley and by UAC staff members Drew Hardesty and Trent Meisenheimer who visited the site of the avalanche the following day with the third guide, Anna Keeling.

1) We triggered several small slides along the summer trial about 5 minutes from the truck. All seemed to be wind loaded by downhill winds. One notable one was triggered from 300 feet away!

We descended the trail and skinned up through dense trees to regain the trail.

2) We spotted a natural avalanche once we gained the Mineral/Mill B ridgeline. It was about 8-10 inches deep. More importantly, it was about 300 feet wide. It was unclear if wind loading triggered it or if a cornice triggered it. Another was nearby about 50 feet wide.

3) We triggered a couple more slides. One by simply walking along the ridgeline and initiating a collapse that cracked the cornices and triggered a pocket about 50 feet wide.

We used the second slide as a way to safely descend to lower angled terrain back to the trail.

4) Lastly I triggered a small pocket along the summer trail. Sort of intentionally, but it pushed me downhill about 10-15 feet. It broke about 25 feet wide. This pocket was a small open area right next to our skin track when we bypassed a section of trail by skinning through dense trees. I was curious if it would slide, but was skiing down and didn't think enough about it before jumping onto the slope. Its always amazing how much power the snow has even very very small slides.

I was up in this area with my pals from the UDOT snow safety team about a week ago during the high pressure.  We all noted how weak the snow was in this area.  Both the surface and near the ground had weak faceted snow and we speculated that it was weak enough that it wouldn't hold much weight from new snow storms.  Looks like our assumptions were right.  It was difficult to see the initial fracture but the avalanche definitely ended up gouging to the ground as it ran.  Wind drifting no doubt played a role here.

We didn't really guess on how much water it would take before avalanches occurred but I attempted to measure it today.  It was a bit difficult due to how much the wind had stirred things up but my rough measurements were 14.5"" of snow over the last week on top of the old faceted snow surface.  The 14.5"" of snow contained about 1.6"" of water.

Of note, the paths that threaten the road lower in the canyon still don't hold much total snow.  At the forks of the Huntington I measured 6"" that fell over the last week.  It contained .47"" water.

Below, decent pile of debris with a few logs in it.
","Also of note, the wind direction did not lend to loading the large road cut near the Electric Lake Dam which is a usual suspect of hitting the road.  The strong northwest wind actually stripped it rather than loading it.","Assessment:  This storm ended just as the scales were about to be tipped.  A few more hours of snow and wind and this area would have gone through a much more widespread natural avalanche cycle.  This was the only notable avalanche that I was able to see.  The weak snow remains near the ground now with a decent slab on it.  It will be need to be monitored with any significant new snow storm.","This small avalanche did break off a few trees but it probably didn't take much to snap them since this was the site of a large forest fire.  All of the trees are just charred trunks that have been standing for a number of years."

General Comments: We got away with a very bad decision today without suffering any consequences.  After multiple great runs on Chicken Shit Ridge (CSR), we decided to exit via the skier's left side of Days Draw.  We knew it had run to the ground Dec. 23rd and there were still weak facets.  Our thinking was there was about 2 feet of snow sitting on top of the ground and there was no evidence of a slab.  There was no wind effect on any of the snow in the area and we had seen no cracking or settlement or any other signs of instability.  There were two sets of tracks from the previous day on the right side of Days Draw.  By the end of the day, the 9 people from 3 parties had made a lot of tracks on CSR, so the uncut snow on Days Draw was very appealing.  We have skied this slope many many times over the years and knew the terrain very well.  We discussed the potential risks and decided to proceed.  As you can see/hear in the video, our biggest concern was hitting rocks in the shallow snow near the top of the run.  We thought we might get some loose snow sluffs but expected them to be manageable.

 

I went first and hit a rock on my second and 4th turns.  When I was about 200 vertical feet down the slope I saw the slope begin to shatter like a window pane beneath my skis and to my left.  I skied off to the right and stopped.  The avalanche released about 100-150 vertical feet above me, was about 70-100 feet wide and it rocketed down the slope which is about 35-38 degrees in that area.  The upper-most crown was on a slight convex part of the slope.  The ground and some remaining old facets were the bed surface.  It entrained quite a bit of snow, gathered a lot of speed and plowed into the trees below.  It plastered some of the tree trunks to a height of about 6 feet (see photo) and ran 450 vertical feet down the slope.

 

At the place where I stopped the snow did not go downhill, but there were numerous cracks in the snow.  After the avalanche went by, I immediately traversed onto the bed surface of rocks and old facets.  I could see there really wasn't much snow left above me so I felt safe on the bed surface.  Between me and the top of the slope was mostly rocks, so my two companions could not descend the bed surface to me, and we felt the snow that had not slid yet, was very likely to slide if they attempted to descend in the snow adjacent to the avalanche path.  My companions put their skins back on and walked back to the top of the ridge and descended CSR.

 

From where I was standing I could see the slide had run all the way to a bench a few hundred vertical feet below me.  I knew there was little avalanche danger on the much more gentle terrain below the bench and felt that it was safer for me to descend than to attempt to gain the ridge through the hang fire and rocks.  I side slipped and skied the bed surface and debris to the bench and then skied to the bottom and met my companions.

 

I’ve included a photo of the crown, a photo of the bed surface which was mostly rocks and facets, a photo looking down the path at the snow plastered on some trees, a photo looking across the width of the slide, and a photo of the toe located 450 vertical feet below the crown.

 

The avalanche is very difficult to see in the video, but the 1 minute video does provide some sense for how far down the slope I was when the avalanche broke out above me.  In the video, you can see when I stopped skiing as the slope was breaking up.

 

Again, we completely underestimated the likelihood of a slab on this slope and I’m feeling very fortunate we didn’t suffer any consequences for our poor judgement.

On our last run, skier 3 remotely triggered the wide steep zone that typically slides on the glade. The result cause the adjacent slope (skier's left of the first role over) to sympathetic. The resultant slide ran full full track, with the debre pile well into the flats. Initially we were not sure if we triggered the slide and did a beacon search of the slide zone. The only warning flag we noticed was the accumulation rate, compounded by the upside down snow pack. We didn't stick around to dig a pit and check for the weak layer due to the safety of being on the slope with high precip rates. I would guess facets near the ground. No collapsing, no cracking noted.. Reported to be not the upper headwall but further skier's left and down by the steeper rollover.

The release of the larger avalanche seemed to be a bit delayed, so that the snowboarder was well out of the avalanche's path by the time it reached the runout zone. The second snowboarder and another skier came down after the avalanche stopped. 

The center and E part of the slide seemed to have broken near the ground in the faceted layer, the part on the W seemed to have broken at the old/new snow interface.

I am thankful for that.

I was skiing the skiers right side of the comma bowl tight to the trees which has a more gentle slope, about 32 degrees.  further to the left the slope angle gets up to 35 to even 37 degrees, which is where the photo shows the slide broke out.   I skied the entire steeper part of my run in dry powder and was turning on the flatter portion of the run (25 degrees) when i was hit from behind first with soft snowballs then i heard the rush of the avalanche.  I made a last turn to the left before i was hit, which fortunately got me out of the middle of the slide path.  The slide took both skis off instantly and i began to swim,  always able to see daylight.  the slide carried me only 50 to 75 feet before it stopped.  i ended up with my head and arms above the snow and unhurt. The tong of the slide stopped about 100' below me.

I yelled for my partner John who yelled back.  We thought we were alone, but with 5 minutes a party of two other skiers appeared out of the trees to the skiers right, then 5 minutes after that  a party of 5 appeared.

My belief is that the slide was remotely triggered by myself once i skied the steeper part of the run as my partners skied to my right and more in the trees.  I don't know what the role of other parties skinning above might have played.  if they were skinning in the same up track that my partner had set there would have been no possible chance that they could have triggered the slide.

Thanks to the assistance of the two parties i was able to get out of the situation, with one person bring a pair of skis down that i could skin up the up track and two other friends relaying a pair of skis up from a friend in Pinecrest.  My partner and i did manage to ski on one ski off the top  500 vertical of lookout and then waited for the rescue skis to get to us.

Forecaster note:  It has been reported that this is a repeater, and the slope had slid earlier this season.

Posting this observation as I haven't seen one yet from the party caught -- they may update. Our party of two was skiing north from the west shoulder of Lookout Peak above Pinecrest. We'd spent most of the day skiing further west on the ridgeline. The snowpack that direction was fairly dense, with the new snow having settled significantly. We did not see any significant cracking, sluffs, or collapsing. As the afternoon went on the weather turned worse, with winds from the SE picking up along the ridge line. Heading up the shoulder of Lookout Peak we encountered a party of 4 and could see the skin track of another party of two ahead of us. A short distance west of the summit we transitioned and decided to ski the trees to the north. We did notice some wind slabs that cracked fairly easily on the ridge, but that was not present just below. A little ways down there is a rollover to the left, and a less steep glade to the right. I went right, the skiing was excellent in there, much lighter than farther down the ridge. Upon stopping around 300' down I Iooked back to my skiers left and saw the crown of a soft slab that had broken right down to the ground interface at the point of the rollover. I thought at first that I'd triggered it remotely. My partner arrived shortly after and moving over to the slide path we called out and got a response from a party of two. They said they were OK, but the person caught had lost both skis. They were working on making their way back up with the party behind trying to walk on the tails of the other's skis. We turned around and cut a skin track back to the ridge along a more mellow angle. During this time the party of 4 came upon the scene and they feared we had been caught and buried -- all accounted for and no injuries we continued to the ridge. The party of four attempted to search the debris field for the missing skis, but felt a significant collapse, and exited. From the ridge two of that party had the good idea of taking my skis back down. Two of us stayed on the ridge line, the rest went back down to reach the party of two and guide them back up our skin track. Winds continued to increase, there was definitely snow moving to the leeward north slope, which may have been a contributing factor in the slide. Ultimately, all parties reached the ridge. The party of two caught in the slide decided to go one ski each and make their way down that way. Meanwhile another group was coming up from pinecrest with a pair of skis. We continued with them to a sheltered point just before you head down into the pinecrest gully. That's where we left the group. We met the party headed up with the extra skis on the way down. Just one picture of the slide crown, but you can see it broke down to the facets on the ground. Glad no one was hurt. And, nice to see three different groups of skiers work together to help out.

Saw fresh debris at the bottom and went to the starting zone. It looks like it was triggered from a cornice fall which initially triggered a shallow wind slab. It was not very wide (30-50' at most) but ran full track. Much of Depth Hoar Bowl slid on 12/23 and the current snowpack is thin and faceted. Looking at the bed surface there are some rocks and bushes visible so likely the slide ran on the weak, faceted snow. Given that much of the starting zone had filled in, am guessing the weak snow couldn't hold much of a load and the slide occurred earlier during the wind event. 

The Gobblers ridgeline above Alexander Basin is a cornice factory - some of the best in the Wasatch! We were able to kick several fresh cornices along the ridgeline that only generated sluffing within the storm snow.

Sluffing off the cliffs from above combined with the 12 inches of new snow, and it overloaded the weak layer, and ran on the old firm bed surface from the slide that released during the Christmas Avalanche Cycle. This slide was a Storm Slab Avalanche with a Persistent Weak Layer as a contributing factor. 

Of Note, the steep rider's left entrance at the top of Stupid Chute had a well defined Soft Slab fracture similar to the widespread cycle that occurred early Friday morning, and this may have also played a roll in sympathetically triggering the much deep soft slab previously described. 

Other areas observed that had this 6 to 8 inch Soft Slab activity included: Rider's left wall above 100 turn gully, areas of the XY Chutes, small area in Rocky Points east facing, Lower Wolverine Chutes East facing, and a WNW small pocket on rider's right side of Sunset.

Most of the upper bowl is scraped to the ground.  Descending from Murdock towards North Bowl we triggered a hard wind slab in Dirt Chute.  North Bowl and everything up high on Murdock was scour.  The snow in the trees and out Lambs was good.","","The fracture line was jagged.  The 8' is a conservative estimate because I did not want to get too close.  The 4 blocks against the trees are each 6 to 8 feet in height and very dense.  I'd say average depth across the 200' jagged fracture was 3-4'.  The hang fire and the whole scene still seemed to have a lot of stored energy.  

I am uncertain but I don't think this was a repeater.  I have attached images from 12/13 showing where I dug around in the location that this slide occurred.  On 12/13, there was a significant wind slab above facets.  The slide seemed to start with wind load then step to the facets at the ground.

The path in in the attached photo heading towards my descent to the snow pit is about where I was today when I triggered the slide.  It was a rather loud slide.  Imagine cutting 4 large cornices simultaneously after the usual wave-like collapse.  The branch snapping added a nice effect.

Prior to the holiday storms, there was quite a contrast between North Bowl and Todd's Bowl.  North Bowl was 50-60 cm of facets top to bottom with a slight inversion.  Dirt Chute was new snow over wind slab over facets or heavy dense snow over facets. 

The 12/23 slide was impressive.  It ran farther than anything I have seen run on this mountain since 2003-2004.",""

I've done this tour that last 3 or 4 years on New Years day as it is generally safe and has an old road to by pass the scrub oak even in low snow years. However, since we knew of a party skiing the same route yesterday, rather than taking our normal route up, we instead opted to save time following their skin track one ridge further north.

Once we reached 8000', we were already experiencing quite and bit of wind out of the East and we decided that a summit descent wasn't going to happen and that we'd just go to timberline and ski down through the aspens. The track we followed also was definitely not better than the normal route, so we were moving more slowly than expected. Between us and our descent of choice was a fairly open, slightly brushed WSW slope that yesterday's skin track crossed. Open seeing the slope, I noticed that a gully was being cross loaded and about a hundred feet below the skin track a small (2-4"" by 10') pocket had pulled out. The skin track crossed the gully higher and was safe (there was a smaller 1"" deep pocket above a flat that cracked when I hit it with a pole). We spread out and continued, wary but not too concerned. I had briefly considered putting in a new track up to the ridge to avoid crossing the slope, but didn't say anything (wanting to get out of the wind quickly) and continued across.

A few hundred yards latter, I spotted a couple of obvious pillows. The left was 30' wide by 20' tall, and the right was 40' wide by 20' tall. The track went below the left one with plenty of breathing room both towards the toe of the right pocket. When I tested it with a ski tip, the perimeter of the pocket cracked all the way around but did not slide. Their appeared to be 2""-10"" deep pencil-hard windslab. On the other side was sheltered, low angle terrain. I stopped and waited for another member of our party to decide what to do, not wanting to cross the pocket that had cracked. We agreed that it would probably be okay to carefully skin between the left and right pockets and then cross over the top of the right-hand pocket were it had cracked out. I started up but by this time the other members of the group had nearly caught up with us and we didn't realize that they had just moved below the left hand pocket.

After a couple of narrowly spaced kick turns, the slope above me and the left-hand pocket all slide. Where I was, the slap was only 3-4"" thick and I stayed put (although it packed some punch and I was not certain I was going to stay were I was). The partner I had consulted with was directly below me and also managed to arrest before going anywhere. The pocket to our left, however, turned out to be tucked in under a small rock, allowing the slab to be 2' deep at that point (much to our surprise). The large slab went directly towards the other three members of our party. One managed to get out of the way, another was carried a few feet, but the third was hit directly and carried about 40'. He managed to grab a 3"" aspen which promptly broke off in his hand but slowed him enough for the slide to go by. At the same time, I was able to quickly kick turn and move into the bed surface to maintain visual contact.

At this point everyone was okay, but the wind was still blowing hard. Three of us retreated to slightly safer ground while another went down to help search for a missing ski. After ten minutes of searching we found nothing and didn't feel comfortable lingering so we retreated minus one ski. One think we noted afterwards was the chaos associated with the slide. While I was ready to dive down and start digging if necessary, the un-caught member of our group didn't know that anyone had taken ride - we would have been wise to take 30 seconds to communicate before taking any action.

The slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche.  One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb.   On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope.  The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill.  

The avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris.    The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured.  He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface.  

The other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly.  He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in ""really only a couple minutes.""   Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries.   The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole.  

 ","This slope has a particularly notable history of avalanche accidents.  It is the site of an epic January 11, 2014 rescue, where a rider was fully buried, suffered a double femur fracture, and had to be hauled up 1600' by rope.   The rescue ended up going on well into the night, and involved about 50 rescuers from Cache, Franklin, and Bear Lake Counties.  Read Report

The same slope was the site of a tragic fatality on February 19, 2000.  Read Report 

The avalanche occurred on a mostly east facing slope and started at around 9200' in elevation.  The toe of the avalanche was at around 8700'.  The slope measures only about 36 degrees in steepness in the steepest area, and I measured the Alpha angle of this avalanche at 25 degrees.","","","It looks like a sledder got caught and carried in this large avalanche, but I don't know the scary story,  The sustained 36 degree slope in the starting zone is not extremely steep, but the avalanche was pretty large.  Tracks and evidence of excavation in the huge debris pile tell the story of a close call and I'd love to hear what actually happened. ","",""

I saw the remains of an ~ 500 ft wide slide that spanned most of the west side of upper DB bowl as I skinned and skied a nearby sub-ridge. I was at probably 1/2 mile away so all of the following are rough estimates. Crown 2-3 ft. Starting elevation about 8800. NW aspect. Ran at least 200' vertical but could be longer as I couldn't see the runout from my vantage point. Date/Time unknown. Trigger--likely natural as I didn't see any other tracks nearby. Also of interest, bed surface was completely white -- didn't see any grass, rocks, brush, or cone flowers sticking up which I would take to mean that the slide broke half way down through the snow pack (rather than on the bed facets). Since timing is unknown, alternatively, the slide could have ran during the last storm cycle and new accumulation covered the bed. The slide looked fresh/recent though. Based on the weather (see below), I think the slide was recent and caused by wind loading.

Weather today was calm in the canyon but extremely windy on the Little Baldy ridge. Above DB and Exit, wind was out of the SE. Lots of snow transport and loading N/NW aspects such as the face of DB that slid. Near and on the ridge, there were extremely variable conditions that ranged from beautiful, soft settled powder, to complete scour, to soft wind slabs 1"" thick that broke in cookie crumble pieces with no energy while skinning, to hard wind slabs up to 5"" thick that broke in chair to desk sized pieces with a bit of energy. In places, the skin track was completely filled back in with a hard slab an hour or so later on the second run.

It looks like the sled triggered slide happened around noon today. judging by this id say we have turned the corner from the wide spread natural cycle. the snow pack is just comfortable enough that it needs a trigger to set it off. It also sounds like this slide was triggered by the 3rd or 4th track put in, so not only does it need a trigger but it might let that trigger get well out onto the slope before it fails. I saw these slides at varying elevations and slope angles. The most common denominator was that they all had and easterly component to them. The other common trait i noticed was they all ran longer than usual. I have seen these paths avalanche quite a bit, and I don't recall many hitting the road.

Unable to get out of way she was caught, carried about 20', and partially buried.  I was not far away to the skiers left and could see her boot so I went immediately there.  She was partially buried near the surface, head up, and uninjured. 

The slide ripped to the ground on some steep rocks above where she had stopped.  Crown was about 3.5'-4', about 40' wide, and slid total of about 100', though most of the debris seemed to stop at the bottom of the cliffs, above where my partner was originally standing.  No pictures of the slide were taken in the haste of getting out of there safely.

I was about 200' down the ridge, when I set off a large collapse on a fairly flat area.  A deep crack propagated up and down the ridge for quite some distance, and although I didn't immediately see or hear any other collateral damage, I was suspicious of the large slide path starting where the Syncline trail wraps around the ridge separating Dry and Logan canyons.  When I skinned back up the ridge I saw that nearly the entire bowl above this slide path had released, between about 3 and 7 feet deep.  From a distance, it appeared to release initially and cleanly on the facets near the ground, with no intermediate interfaces playing a role.  It looks like this starting zone was loaded heavily from wind ripping across the far NW end of the Folly; 100 meters away on a windward aspect, there was less than a foot of snow total.  There were numerous deep cracks shooting across the relatively low-angle section of the ridge, but ultimately the avalanche released a bit lower and didn't quite 'pull the carpet out'.  Because of this, there was a lot of hangfire remaining, so I didn't attempt to check out the bed surface below the crown.","","Photo 4 shows the location of the remote trigger, about 200 feet down the ridge and WNW of the crown.",""

This demonstrates exactly what kind of conditions you will encounter out there right now.  You might not see many obvious signs of instability until you tickle the right slope.  The early season snow should not be trusted right now.  It remains weak and after the large recent storm, it is still prone to collapsing and causing dangerous avalanches.

Just as I was about to drop in, I saw two slide paths come down into the apron of Baldy in Collins Gulch. I could see one person in the slide on the west end. He was up and moving out of the slide shortly after the debris came to a halt. I dropped in and rode to the bottom. Shortly after I got to my car, the victim came down on his skis and said he had a broken rib and other injuries. He said he was pushed over a cliff. I helped him with his gear to the car and waited till the paramedics arrived. My picture is not the best, but you can see the debris pile in the center of the image with the skier in the center of the debris pile. The two skiers in the foreground are looking in the direction on the slide. 

Here is a summary from Peter Donner who emailed information a day later:

Storm came in Saturday May 9 and left about 1 foot of about 10 percent snow on Baldy.  Skied two runs in Collins Gulch Saturday, finished the day summiting Baldy, skiing the Main Chute.

Began the day Sunday May 11 with the objective to ski an area of the Baldy Shoulder I'd never skied.  Been looking at it for years, wanting to ski it, but conditions were never right.

Summited Baldy around 10am Sunday and skied the line I'd been eyeing.  Google Earth image below.  The area delineated in red is the approximate area of the avalanche and the area I skied.

The line is tricky since it bottoms at a cliff band so you have to cut skier's left above the cliff for a safe exit.  Off the peak the slope steepens to about 45 degrees then flattens to about 30 degrees in a small draw which feeds into the cliff.

After first run decided to do a second.  Snow on the first run was dry.  Ascending Baldy began chatting with Skier A.  I had seen A Saturday booting up the Main Chute.  He explained he didn't know the area and this was his first time on Baldy 

Shoulder.  We talked about skiing the line I had just skied.  We summited Baldy together around 11am.  It was warm.  I had taken my jacket off at the bottom and did not put it on.  The sky was clearing and the snow was heating, though still excellent.  I deskinned, told A I was dropping, skied the line, stopped in upper Main Street, reskinned, began to ascend toward Germania Pass.  About 5 minutes had passed since I had started the run.

As I was climbing I noticed an avalanche coming down the line I had just skied.  A was in the avalanche which carried him over the cliff band bringing him to a stop at about the location of the star in the image below.  He was on top of the debris and extremely coherent and mobile given his experience.  He was in pain and thought he had broken a rib.  Both his skis released, though they were right with him.  He had all his gear but his goggles, which must have ripped off in the ride.  He got organized, put his skis on and we descended to Goldminers Daughter together.

Both my tracks were taken out by the avalanche.

And here is yet another account from a bystander:

Our party was approximately 150-200 yards away from the skier's final stopping point at the end of this slide, and we were able to reach him immediately after the avalanche. We watched his run down the high shoulder and wondered where he was heading, as he was staying towards the main chute side of the shoulder. Apparently, this was his second run on the high shoulder, but it was obvious he stayed more skier's right this time, and that is when the slab triggered above him (10-20 ft ??). He was carried over the gut of the cliff (pictures below), which propagated another slide below the apron. I continued to catch glimpses of his body as he went over another set of smaller cliffs, and saw him swimming to the top of the debris pile as settled several hundred feet below. When the avalanche was over, the skier was facing downhill with his chest exposed above the snow, and I believe he was only partially buried below the waist, and was able to dig himself out of the debris. He immediately signaled that he was ok, and we began our ascent up to him (we had already called dispatch). Once we reached him, he thought he had broken some ribs, and was able to get back on his gear and continue down to the base. This was honestly the scariest moment I have witnessed in the backcountry, and I hope this person knows how lucky they are.

Then we noticed more snow coming down and a snowboarder appeared, gopro on pole and everything. He stopped, saw us and didn't give us time to get out of his fall line before continuing.  Based on a short conversation after he fell near us, I think a complete lack of knowledge on his part. This is based partly on the fact that he called me ""sir"" when apologizing after a brief lecture (family friendly).

Some minor green housing during the late morning.  Snow below 9,000' was damp and a bit spongy on our exit at 12.30.

From Canyons snow safety - Skier remotely triggered from ridgetop. Two pockets each about 50' wide.  Total snow depth in this area is 130cms.  It has slid multiple times this year.  The snowpack structure consists of faceted snow from the ground to 70cms up from ground and the top 60cms is snow from the previous few storms with the first one on February 20th.
The slide path is called La Frontera and we control this area from time to time to prevent bigger slides from hitting the ski area.  We do not control this area after every storm nor do we control this area for skier traffic as it is out of bounds and not part of the ski area.

This uptrack was originally put in by forecaster Drew Hardesty and he did not trigger any avalanches at the time, so it occurred afterwards.  Perhaps it was remotely triggered by another party or perhaps it was a natural.

Blake Ford Avalanche Incident Hells Canyon March 4, 2015 

The winter of 2014-15 up to early March was record setting for both warmth and lack of snow.  In 35 seasons of consistent record keeping at Snowbasin ski resort March 1st 2015 was the record lowest in both annual snow and settled snow.  The last few days in February and early March there were some small storms adding up to about 4-6”.  On the morning of March 3rd the area reported 15 inches of new snow.  Reduction work that morning resulted in widespread class 2/3 avalanche activity both with ski cuts and explosives.  Much of the resort terrain stayed closed that day.  The next day more reduction work was done with the goal of opening the rest of the resort terrain.  Reduction work in the morning resulted in another round of class 2/3 avalanches.  At 9:19 AM the No Name area was opened.  There was a long line at the bottom of the tram and guests were anxious to finally ski some powder after a long dry winter. 

Colby Oldroyd and Blake Ford long time friends from Morgan Utah took the day off work to snowboard at the resort.  Blake was a former employee at the resort and a season pass holder for nine seasons.  Colby had been a previous pass holder in the Park City area for two seasons, and this was his first season pass at Snowbasin.  They took their first run down John Paul and the next lap rode the Mt. Allen Tram to access the No Name terrain.  The two of them travelled across the top of No Name and entered the Hells Canyon area.  Blake had limited familiarity with the terrain, and Colby had only been there one time before.  They traversed into the area about 50 yards when Colby felt that the terrain was too dangerous and they should get back to the ski area.  They were traversing back to the ski area boundary when Blake who was out ahead was caught in the avalanche.  Colby witnessed the slide and followed the path down yelling for his friend.  On the way down he found a glove and the goggles of his friend.  When he did not find Blake he attempted to call him by phone, when that failed he contacted Snowbasin Ski Patrol.  In a brief interview with Colby it was determined that Blake was the only one known to be in the area, and he was not wearing an avalanche beacon. Colby travelled back to the resort and was met by Ski Patroller Zaun Barnes who escorted Colby back to the top of Hells Canyon.

At this same time ski patroller Corey Kruse was making an observation tour of the boundary to check for any traffic into the area.  As he was standing at the boundary he heard voices of individuals in the terrain.  He then heard screams of someone caught in an avalanche and also saw in the distance snow traveling down the mountain, soon after that he heard another person yelling and searching.  At this point Corey informed Ski Patrol dispatch of the event.  Life Flight was called to fly the scene and plans made to form a rescue party.

G.R Fletcher was riding in Mt. Allen Tram when the call came in.  He proceeded to No Name gate one and closed the gate.  Also at this time a rescue party was being organized at the top of John Paul and explosives were being assembled.  All other gates into the No Name terrain were being closed.  Eventually a rescue party consisting of Snowbasin ski patrollers G.R Fletcher, Peter Francis with rescue dog Molly, Jared Bradley with hasty party flags and a RECCO, Jeff Whiting, Joe Marchione, Tommy Keating with explosives, Mike Erickson with explosives, and Jason Neumann all met at the top of No Name near the access point to Hells Canyon.

Hells Canyon is a steep area with multiple paths that all converge in a single gully at the bottom.  The Blake Ford avalanche only released a small amount of the potential snow in the start zones.  At the top of Hells Canyon it was observed that there were four tracks into the area.  Two went down a generally safe ridge to the north and two went toward the slide path in question.  After Life Flight confirmed the slide path and that no one was observed in the path or in the terrain.  A group discussion was conducted concerning potential hazards, search urgency and potential safe routes into the scene.  Eventually it was decided that a small group consisting of Mike Erickson with the explosives as Hasty Party leader, Peter Francis and Molly the dog, and Jared Bradley with the RECCO, would travel safely and carefully to the avalanche path using explosives as necessary.  Once on the path they would follow that down to the debris pile.  The rest of the group would wait for confirmation of a safe route to the site.    

The hasty party followed the tracks to the start zone.  In order to remove potential hazards on both sides of the avalanche path explosives were thrown.  These released avalanches just as large as the original avalanche and both funneled into the same gully.  After arrival on the scene Erickson requested more help, and the second party began their descent into the scene.  By this time the second party was joined by Corey Kruse, Zaun Barnes and the witness Colby Oldroyd. This group used the explosive protected slide path to the right to access the primary path and then descend to the scene.

Once on the debris Molly was put into an active search.  She had a strong alert 75 yards into the deposition pile.  Erickson and Bradley began probing the area.  With the probing in progress Molly continued to search the rest of the debris pile.  Molly alerted again about 20 yards from the toe of the debris.  Francis probed the area and had a positive strike on his second probe.  When the victim was extricated at 1140 it was determined that he had injuries incompatible with life.  At this point hoist extrication by Life flight was requested.  

After Blake was hoisted to the base area, the rescue party traveled together to the staging area and the incident was terminated at 1246.","Thanks to KSL News for the aerial photos.","","","","",""

After assessing conditions, first skier went in and made hard cuts to check snowpack and set outer boundaries for skiers to observe/follow - no problem observed. Second skier in made hard turns - no problem. Third skier (me) in - after two turns below coming in under the cornice, I observed the snow below me breaking loose, I turned my head and saw that the avalanche was in full swing above/below/around me, which eliminated a ski out/outrunning option - the fourth skier (observing from cornice above), saw the slide begin, surround me and screamed ""PULL PULL PULL!!!"" which confirmed to me that I was in an active avalanche and that I needed to activate my ABS Bag - I pulled my ABS Bag trigger - the bag fully deployed (I will cherish forever that ""hissing"" sound as it inflated!) - and then I went for one heck of a ride - I came to rest at the lower portion of the debris field below the rocks, face up, partially buried with all equipment off. The fourth skier came around the from the top of the debris field, beacon set to receive, saw me give him the ""thumbs up"", skied from one debris field across to the one I was in and assisted in helping me out. While digging out, me and fourth skier hear multiple ""whumps"" as snow around us settled. IMPORTANT note: the ABS Bag was a lifesaver - no question, no hesitation - I was kept on top of the slide which pulled me over the rocks (I continued to see light filtering through the snow as I tumbled and ""swam"") - I suffered minor injuries (hamstring tweak from a ski initially staying on and minor arm bruising) - absolutely NO hits to my head (helmet was free of any markings). Anyone who questions the efficacy of a Avy Bag (ABS in this case): I'm living proof that it works. NOTE: My family is UNAWARE of what transpired so my name is not included.

While it did have some blocky avalanche debris, I cannot confirm that the slab was 1F or harder.  I will call it a SS-ASu-R2-D2 that failed on what appeared to be 1.5mm facets on a North aspect at about 10k. Around 100ft wide, ran about 700ft and the crown depth was up to 3ft. Due to it breaking into old faceted snow we believe it was a Persistent Slab. 


          On the drive to LCC we made persistent slabs our number one concern today in the terrain we were traveling. We looked past a number of warning signs. These included finding a thin rocky snowpack on the entrance (facets), the fact that Mongo No had already slid this year, and seeing many avalanches on similar aspects and elevations. (Although we categorized those as storm/wind slabs that likely lost the energy by today.) We counted eight avalanches just from our view from the top of Mongo No. Just that alone should have kept us on more conservative terrain. We though that the structure was better than it was, and that there was less energy in the snowpack. We were wrong, the structure in that spot and I assume in many other rocky areas in Mineral was weaker than we figured.  This was also our third run of the day and I feel we had too much confidence brewing. Triggered from the skiers right flank of the slide.  

          I was able to ski off the slab and out of harms way but the side was in unforgiving terrain and I was lucky. Booted up and out of that terrain and went down a lower angle slope that had a fatter and stronger snowpack where we stayed the rest of the day. Credit goes to UAC for the accurate forecast of persistent slab problem on high east aspects for the morning of 3/4/15. ​

Our party of 3 experienced backcountry skiers set out just before 0500, skinned up Argenta, skied a mellow line on the Catcher's mitt, booted up the East Couloir, and opted to ski back down Argenta instead of the East Couloir for much better snow quality. We descended the ridge west from the top of Kessler, careful not to dip into the steep terrain on either side. As I was skiing the trees of the ridge around 10,000ft, I hit a rock garden that had been covered by the new snow. This caused me to lose my ski and fall onto the low 30s degree angle slope which rolled over into a slope which appproached 40 degrees much further downhill. I stood up and began probing for my ski, which appeared to have torpedoed about 5 feet below me. I stepped a few feet below where I had landed--I would guess that the slope was 35 degrees at that point--and felt the slab begin to slide beneath me. It broke out 3-5 feet above where I was standing. Luckily, I was standing by a tree and was able to grab onto a limb, which allowed me to pull myself up while the ground gave way. The other members in my party were luckily still on the ridge and out of the way. The slab was quite cohesive consolidated new snow. The interface at which it slid did not appear faceted or rotten. It broke out around 50 feet across and funneled down over a large cliff. The impact of the avalanche falling over the cliff propagated another slide, with a crown that appeared to be 4-5 feet. I watched from above and shouted warnings as I saw the slides continuing downhill. As we were not sure if anyone had been caught or carried, my two partners left me quickly and found a safe way down to the debris. There they encountered a party of two who watched the slide and did not believe there were any other parties ascending or descending between us. My partners performed a beacon search and found no buried persons. 
As one of my partner's phone was dead and the other on airplane mode, I no longer had contact with them and I did not know whether there were any injured parties. As such, I snapped a few quick pictures of the crown, but did not have time to thoroughly investigate it. I descended via the skin track on one ski until I reached mellower terrain (apologies to anyone skinning up later...). I reached my partners at the base of the debris and saw that the other two parties were approaching the lower, 4-5 foot crown to investigate (perhaps they will post photos). 

Note: if anyone finds a BD Amperage ski with Dynafit bindings in the debris, I would love it back. Please contact UAC if found. Beer and good karma in it for you!

My take on the incident:
The same three skiers in our party lapped Cardiff peak yesterday and noticed some mild sluffing underfoot and also visualized moderate soft slab natural avalanches on two trees. We were aware of the rapid loading which took place and knew the avi forecast well, and knew that there was potential for activity today. We checked out the dawn patrol forecast and were aware of the recent natural avalanche cycles down south and potential for slab activity on steep north-facing slopes. We planned to ski the Catcher's Mitt and did so at the lower angle route. We planned to ride the ridge from Kessler west until we reached more moderate terrain before dropping in. I had no intentions of skiing where the avalanche occurred. I was incredibly fortunate to have a tree beside me which I was able to grab onto. Otherwise I may well have ended up at the bottom of a very large cliff. I did not expect the new snow interface to give so easily and on a relatively moderate roll-over, but the steeper terrain below the rollover was sufficient to release the slab. I considered the risk of descending another few feet to retrieve my ski, and felt that an avalanche was highly unlikely based on this action. I was wrong.

Lessons: We saw red flags today: recent loading, evidence of natural avalanches out in the distance in Broad's fork. There was no collapsing or cracking that I noticed, and no slides apart from gentle sluffs and warm releases of of Kessler. I knew there were pockets of considerable and unfortunately I literally fell right into one. It turns out that trying to make smart decisions with regards to route choice only works most of the time, and you need to be prepared for the worst and hope to get lucky if badness happens.
One of my partner's injured her knee in the backcountry a couple months ago and required extrication. A few of us were able to splint her leg, keep her warm, and extricate her using skins, skis, cordelette, athletic and duct tape, and Voile-style ski straps. Because of accidents like that, I always carry extra layers, an emergency bivy, ski straps, tape, and pain meds. I feel that had there been an injury or burial, my party would have been prepared to respond.
One thing that could have gone better, however, is communication. With phones not working, it was impossible to communicate. This underscores the essential need to carry either a phone or radio that is functional. UAC's iPhone App was awesome for pulling up Alta Central and UAC numbers to report the incident.

After checking that avalanche out we continued up the ridge to see how sensitive things were.  With some walking around on the ridge we managed to remotely trigger two more slides that connected to the other.  These three avalanches together were 400-500 ft wide and 1'-2.5' ft deep.  We worked our way back down the ridge towards the tracks of the party that triggered the original avalanche.  Again we were able to remotely trigger another avalanche.  This avalanche was about 150 ft wide and 1.5 ft deep and released on a mid-slope roll, it also took out the skin track from the original party.

Two feet plus of new snow on the Manti Skyline out of this recent storm.  We hadn't been down for a number of weeks now so we needed to approach things cautiously to see what was going on with the new snow.  It was very deep and almost too deep to travel.  There was way too much snow to get into some of our favorite bowls right off the get-go so we started out on low angled west facing terrain, not steep enough to slide.
","After we were done looking at the crown and were getting ready to descend the bed surface, I went over to the west flank to have a quick look.  I poked my pole in to the flank where it hadn't avalanched and noted to my partner Lara how weak the snow was down deep.  I picked up one of my skis and half-ass kicked into the flank and got a large collapse.  The adjacent slope cracked out and slid about 30 feet farther into the flank.","All of the upper bowl had slid during the the pre Xmas natural avalanche cycle leaving only about 18"" of snow on the ground.  It never really snowed again until now.  The slopes are very steep, 40 degrees or more and face north.  This is the perfect set up for faceting despite the very warm temperatures we experienced in January and February.

This is a dangerous set up for the unaware.  You can easily ride east, south and west facing slopes without worry.  Some north facing slopes that didn't slide during December may not avalanche either.  Some north facing slopes that see regular sled traffic may not slide either.  But it wouldn't be hard for someone to travel for most of the day and then get onto one of these northerly facing slopes which harbor a weak shallow snowpack due to avalanching in December.  ""Booby traps"" is a good analogy.","We didn't note anything too significant within the new snow but did experience one collapse while ascending near the top.  It was a buried layer of facets associated with a heat crust.  Kind of odd to have a collapse on a west face like that.  There was an avalanche on the north facing portion of the bowl which ran during the southerly storm flow on Monday.  We decided that it would be safe to walk up the bed surface and we could figure out what the weak layer was that caused the slide.  This would be very important information for us as to how we would decide stability on the more northerly slopes we wanted to get into over the next couple of days.  Upon getting to the bed surface, we noted about 12"" of new snow which was on top of the debris.  This put the time of the avalanche before the cold front passed on Tuesday.  The avalanche was 12 to 14"" deep and we quickly determined the weak layer was facets.  At that point, all bets were off with any ideas of skiing some of our favorite big northerly facing bowls.  If the weakness had been within the new snow, we would've waited another day and then got into the bigger terrain."

The slab obviously was not 3 days old, thus this would be called a Storm Slab overloaded by Wind with a Persistent Weak Layer. The Collapse Failure appeared to be a result of a Facet/Crust/Facet/Crust Sandwich, and the upper Crust that Collapsed and failed was Knife Hard and was 3 cm thick. The Bed Surface Crust was Ice Hard and this Crust was from the Warm High Pressure that was in place prior to the latest batches of small storm events that occurred in the last weeks of February. This upper part of the sandwich that failed was in place and was the snow surface prior to last Thursdays snow event.

Had enough force to at least knock down my partner. Pretty decent size powder cloud. Ran about 50 yards past the summer trail. This is an exposed area below Kessler my partners and I have always been concerned with in the right conditions. Usually spreading out when crossing it with partners we have often wondered; What are the chances? With high precip rates and things changing rapidly during the peak of the frontal passage, today was the day. Definitely an area to treat with caution with high west winds, high precip rates or both. I tried to enhanced photos to show debris and serious dumpage! Things settled down about an hour later.

FORECASTER NOTE:  This avalanche actually released from high in the starting zone between The High Pockets and The Catcher's Mit.  We were able to view it after the storm cleared.  It ran around 1200' vertical distance.  It is quite common for these paths to cross the road below and the road which is the route up to George's Bowl.  Often people choose George's Bowl because it is low angled and generally safe but they fail to recognize the greater hazard that exists while traveling in or exiting underneath the east facing slopes of Mt Kessler.  Kobernik

The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.
 As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above.  The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche.  I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band.  Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and  I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst.  The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top.  It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.
It certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below.  Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed.  I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow.  I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.
With the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries.  I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it.  As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4"" of running water below the snow surface.
Another  200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep.  My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile.  Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow.  It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.

Forecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab.  So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.","","","","I doctored it to show where I got swept and where I managed to get off it. I think a whole lot of snow came down from the rocky face below the Buttress.","","I think the cause of the slide was the days strong sun heating up south facing rocks buried beneath the new snow.  The running water I found under the snowpack on my way down after the slide, suggests to me that the slab was heating up and getting wet from below.
A number of human factors  played into the poor decision-making that led to my getting caught in this slide.
First and foremost, after a glorious morning of skiing what seemed like very stable north facing slopes, I was in a state of elation and exhaustion as I started down the south facing.  With the return of more winter like temperatures, I was not as concerned with the wet slide potential.  On top of that, I was running late and in a hurry to get back to Snowbird.  I dropped in to the slope like a victory lap.  The conditions on the other side had made me complacent, and I made no formal assessment of the snowpack, despite the change in aspect.   Lastly, a vastly less exposed route could have been taken, but I didn't want to ski back down around behind the buttress and instead chose the line above the rock band."

They had skiied lower angle terrain that day and on their last run, the first skier (66 y.o) dropped northeast off the ridge into steeper (40* terrain) and triggered a loose snow facet sluff which carried him through a stand of trees for 300' down the slope.  The skier lost all his gear but remained at the top of the shallow debris pile. He sustained no injuries.  His partners watched from above, recovered his gear, and they skiied out to the Spruces trailhead in BCC.  ","The terrain in Days Fork is littered with avalanche terrain - steep east to north facing avalanche paths that are suitable terrain choices when the danger is not elevated.  The Chicken Shit ridge is commonly ascended from the Days drainage and offers low angle switch back terrain that is well navigated by the experienced bc user.  The ridge rises up and to the west, gaining the Benson/Reed ridgeline, separating Days and Cardiff Forks and splits open and forested avalanche terrain on both sides (Crystal Palace, Days Draw, and Hall of Giants are named avalanche paths nearby). 

The skier was caught in a steep northeast facing gladed area midslope at 9400' and carried for 300' through stands of trees.  ","The weather at the time of the incident was mostly cloudy with little wind and temps in the upper 20s.   The month of January has been relatively dry but for a good mid-month storm that produced roughly 26""/1.96"" SWE on the 12th and 13th.  Other than a few weak disturbances over the past couple weeks since that storm, general periods of high pressure has dominated the intermountain region.  Clear skies and inverted temperatures often promote faceting, or weakening of the snow surface which, if prolonged, may result in human-initiated loose snow sluffs, or point releases.  This process had been noted by the UAC staff as well as other backcountry observers, with at least one loose snow sluff initiated and reported on January 20th along the Park City ridgeline.  See pic below 



The overall snowpack was stable and the danger rated for this day was LOW.  Regardless, the Bottom Line indicated, ""The avalanche danger is LOW but remember that your overall risk is amplified by your terrain choices. Minor shallow wind pockets, cornice fall, and shallow loose snow avalanches can be significant for those in severe and unforgiving terrain.""

In this case, the skier triggered a dry loose ""facet"" sluff that caught and carried him for 300' through a stand of trees in steep mid-slope terrain at 9400' off the Chicken Shit Ridge.  It is possible that this particular area had weaker surface snow due to it being mid-elevation, shady, not wind-effected, and possibly thin from previous avalanching this winter.  

Forecaster Comment:  It is reasonable for backcountry parties to choose more aggressive terrain when the avalanche danger is rated as Low or Moderate.  The party was well equipped, experienced, and followed safe travel protocol (one-at-a-time).  As sluffs typically need steeper slope angles to run, it is unlikely that this conservative party would have encountered any loose snow avalanching up until the incident.  No ""snow pits"" would have alerted the party to this type of instability; only the tactile awareness that the riding conditions in the loose cohesive snow remained good.  ","","","",""

Sure enough, cross-reference reveals that there have been two recent slides in the Diving Board: the red arrows indicates what appears to be an overnight event, and the yellow arrows indicate the slide Brett observed on Thursday. 

There are about 6 separate glide avalanches apparent in Broads From from the last ~10 days--kind of a bummer. Are temperatures really so warm that  free water is present in the snowpack on high elevation, shady slopes in mid-January? Or, is it that the dark, smooth quartzite slabs in Broads Fork harbor extremely weak snow in shallower conditions, allowing natural, full-depth slides to occur when the snowpack seems dormant nearly everywhere else?","","",""

I went in to investigate on the 18th and concluded that it was a skier triggered, soft slab avalanche triggered in a steep rocky chute near the summit though details are unclear. The slide ran like a sluff in loose snow for approximately 900' before reaching a steep convexity at the top of a gully where it propagated into a hard persistent slab, fracturing to the ground at a depth of 4'.

Distance and shade prevented seeing actual ski tracks in the starting zone, but a pair of tracks were observed high on the observers right of the broad open face. These tracks eventually made their way down through complex terrain to the observers right of the slide path eventually exiting the area near the debris at the bottom. 

Weather conditions were calm and sunny at the time with NE winds blowing in the single digits. Temperatures at 10,000' were in the low 30's.

Two local skiers were skiing in Tele Gold just prior to the slide and they exited via the observers left side of Tele Heaven sometime between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. The slide was first observed right around 3:00 and the skiers tracks in Tele Heaven were partially covered by the debris. 

This slope is rarely skied in mid winter and access is difficult. The presence of ski tracks on the slope and the lack of avalanche producing weather conditions lead me to conclude that it was a skier triggered avalanche.

Weak layer was a layer of 5-10 mm surface hoar and near surface facets that were preserved underneath last Sunday's (Jan 11) small storm. When I was out on Saturday Jan 10 in Hogum Fork I later made a comment to Drew that I could no longer find any weak snow at the surface. There had been SH and NSF that formed the week of Jan 4, but these weaknesses all seemed to be destroyed by warm temps and wind. Clearly, in some sheltered, shady mid-elevation slopes this weak layer was preserved and was buried by the 5 cms of snow on Sunday Jan 11, and then buried more deeply by the Monday Jan 12 storm. The Monday storm had settled out to a 4F slab that was not responsive to stability tests by Thursday of this week.

Doing a quick crown profile, the weak layer is buried 30-40 cms (12-16"")  down and it is a thin 5 mm layer that is not readily apparent in  quick pit profiles. Did not do an ECT (should have) but shear tests were easy STE with Q1 quality.

Quick hand pits on a few other slopes were not showing this layer of preserved SH and NSF.

The weight of us (three skiers) was enough to remotely trigger the wind slab about 50ft down the ridge from where we stood. Shooting cracks came up the ridge to our feet. I'm estimating it was about 50ft wide and 1-2ft deep. Light was flat and we didnt have a good view of the entire slide from the ridge. Sorry, no photos.  

We skied down the ridge a little and another small NE facing pocket pulled out. The slope was not steep enough for it to run far (maybe 40 feet), but solid evidence of the wind loading that was occurring!! Photo of second pocket below.

Of Note: 

Most east facing Gobblers into Alexanders ran during the last storm.  There were large debris piles at the base of this run as well as Depth Hoar bowl.  (the snow in these piles was soft).These piles were not there prior to the last storm. Everything looked thin (bushes) and we had assumed that we would be dealing with only a partial accumulation of new snow from the last event.  Based on the height of the crown (8-10"") this appears to have been correct.  The snow on west facing Gobblers was deeper (12-14').  This was a repeater in respect to the last storm.

We did know about the slide on Toots from the previous day and assumed that most of the new snow instability had settled out.  This is a good case of not abiding by the ""one red flag trumps all signs/theories of stability"".

Comments by the party that triggered the slide: 
I was standing on the summit of Murdock Peak today around noon and as the second skier approached the summit (elevation 9,600 ft) we heard a collapse that resulted in a shooting crack that propagated eastward resulting in the sympathetic release of of a wind-slab pocket , skier's right of Todd's Bowl (towards Dirt Chute). Although we didn't visibly see the avalanche crown because the ridgeline obscured our sight and we were in a hurry due to a south exit and increasing temperatures, we did see the the debris run down the slope through the spruce/fir. By the amount of debris we could tell it was not a large avalanche. I know some of the people that read this are going to say WTF?, you're reporting an avalanche and you don't know the size? The bottom line is two skiers standing on the Murdock ridge (estimated weight 320 lbs) caused an audible collapse that resulted in a shooting crack on the surface that ran 100 ft east and triggered a sympathetic pocket hardslab avalanche, immediately below the ridgeline, about 25 feet vertical feet below and 100 feet right of us. To quote Fesler I would say that's bull's eye. We avoided the open bowl and skied the north ridge so we weren't in any danger.","","",""

I was trying to get out of this area quickly. There were a few tracks along the ridge before our party reached it and two ahead of me did not have any issues. I went about 40 yards past where my buddy dropped. The aspect changed slightly north at this point and was a bit more exposed and wind blown. The snow pack was about 2 feet deep on the slope and it was a bit more open at the top than areas surrounding it. Forecaster's note - see small arrow in middle of second picture for location. The slope started to break apart around me on my first turn it. It was a soft sugary slab that I though would just sluff off. Fortunately I let my momentum carry me skiers right to get on more stable ground and let it sluff off. I was scraping rocks by the time I got good footing and could grab a tree. The slab actually gained strengh and widened quickly. It sheared at the snow/ground interface and moved into the trees. The trees did not provide an anchor and it continued to widen and gain strength. It finally ran out after 400 or so vertical feet. Getting caught would not have been good.","

Location of the slide taken from near the Guradsman's Pass road looking south.   The terrain is very subtle because from the ridge it slowly gets steeper and steeper until you get into 44 degree, rocky slope with lots thick trees that the avalanche will strain through on the way down.  This is the same slope that caused a fatality in 1994.","","Slope angle on the steepest part of the bed surface is > 40 degrees, we were not able to surmise where the initial point of propagation started.  This would have been a nasty ride and the skier who triggered it is very fortunate to have escaped.  The bed surface contained large areas of exposed rock and fed into a treed area.

It's possible that this is a repeater based on the thin snow cover and the looks of the profile.  But in poking around on many similar slopes on the forest edge the snowpack structure looks similar.  So we're not sure...

Photos:

Looking down along east flank.

West flank, mid-pack crust is visible.

West portion of crown.

East portion of crown, note thin snow pack.

The last two photos show that it is very high consequence avalanche terrain because there are so many trees and rocks.
","Some notes on shear testing on the crown.  the shallow east flank failed in basel facets ranging from ECTP 3 to ECTP 6.  The deeper west flank failed at scores up to ECTP21 and propagation Saw test after cutting only 6"" or so of the block.  These are great tests to calibrate results for day to day testing (e.g. if it propagates, it can slide....).

My partner was partly in the lee of a tree and I did a quick kick turn to try to lunge towards him but it was a fairly futile effort.  Fortunately we were on the flank of the slide and trees above probably broke the power a bit, so the snow washed over me without too much oomph and I only traveled a few feet.  Had I gone further I would have likely gone into a debris pile at a flatter spot above some trees (where my one ski ended up) that wasn’t that deep.  However, out in the more-open terrain to skinner’s left the debris ran far and fast, and we think that it likely ran all the way down the slab shot below. 

 

The thrust of the energy was on the more-easterly aspect; ie NOT on the GLM side and more on the Craig’s Chute side.  Possibly due to the NW windloading from yesterday?  It ran on the facet layer that – where we were – was 3’ deep.  We did not carry on up higher to check out the top crown, but we could see quite a ways up and the remote trigger distance was impressive.  And it appeared to propagate pretty far to the south across those chutes. 

 

Most disconcerting was that there were approximately 13 sets of tracks in that area, and it had been skied (not much) yesterday.  As everyone knows who has skied the last few days, the skiing was sublime, and it certainly didn’t “feel” like we were floating on a hard slab that was ready to run. We had no other signs of instabilities; the new snow was sloughing a little in the steeper trees but was barely noticeable, and a quick hand/pole pit - only about 2 feet deep, and not down to the facet layer, as it turns out - did not indicate any unusual instabilities.  

 

Of note:  most of the skin track was unaffected; ie the typical skin line up to the point where it starts to feel “real’ (steepness) was indeed in the safety zone relative to this particular slide.  However, most of the upper skin track was taken out.   We skied the bed surface down a ways and then realized that we should cut over to the skin line because the other party we had seen may have been ascending and gotten swept down and maybe a rescue might be necessary, but zigzagging deep in the old growth they were blissfully unaware that anything had happened.  Of course, the last few hundred feet of the skinner takes one out of that safer zone and into steeper, more-open terrain where the slide occurred. 

 
","","The snow pack structure is similar to other avalanches triggered in the past weeks. The avalanche failed on a layer of very small grained facets.

The general set up is this...  Early December was abnormally warm and this allowed the snow to settle and gain strength, in some places a crust was formed on the surface. On December 11th a wind event was noted forming wind slabs in the higher terrain. Then we received a storm that brought low density stellar snow that faceted very quickly (Dec 14-15). On December 21-22 this layer was buried and preserved throughout most of the range.

In most of the recent avalanches there has been a crust below the small grained facets. However, that was not the case with this avalanche. I could not find any crust below the weak layer. There was a big difference in hardness between the weak layer and the bed surface. 

I was not comfortable doing a crown profile as there was still hangfire above and adjacent to me. I did, however, dig a snow pit lower on the ridge in a safe location and that picture is below. The arrow points to the weak layer that failed.

We spotted one Avalanche that happened some time during yesterday’s storm.  The Avy was on Brokeback Mountain, an East facing 38ish degree slope half way between the lake and Hunters Cave.  The slide ran about 250 vert and was 50 feet wide involving the new snow and likely started from a wind deposits overloading the new snow at the top of the slide path.  

We dug several pits in a similar area to see how the stability looked.  Each pit was dug on an East to Northeast facing, 26-30 degree slope at around 8500 feet.  The total snow depth was 60-65 inches.  Compression tests failed at 16-20 taps at a layer 20 inches deep.  Another compression test failed at 27 taps down 36 inches on faceted snow that developed during the long early December dry spell.  The 36 inch deep failure was very clean.  The Extended Column Test did not produce any failures after significant pounding on the column.  

All in all it was an incredible day to be in the mountains.  We rode slopes facing all directions and had excellent boarding (and slednecking) on all of them.

Slide was triggered by small air onto slope (Picture 2) from the skiers left rib into the left center of the second bowl (more northerly) in Wilson Glades. First skier was not part of group and had center punched steepest section of the bowl. Second skier was at the base of the slope and experience a loud settling and whump. Slide looks to have been triggered by the energy of third skier landing on the wind slab over 1/2 way down the 400' slope. The slab fractured approx. 100' across the slope to the south-east across the bowl. We reason that the 150' of slope above the trigger point then slid sympathetically. Bed surface was early December snow pack that had decomposed, but was supportable to a persons weight. A bit of stomping on the base surface showed that it was poorly bonded. Approximately 2.5-3' of the snow pack slid, while the total snowpack depth was 4' (Picture 3). The slab was the recent wet storm (Dec . 22nd) and was not particularly firm (4F) and roughly 15-18"" thick (Picture 4). The rime layer was apparent within the slab and was approx. 3 mm thick. Weak layer was December near surface faceted snow (Picture 5), but showed some cohesion and was not typical ""sugar snow"". Majority of the slope was between 32-33 degrees with isolated pockets of 35 degree slopes. A number of the slide blocks remained on the slope attesting to the general low-angle of the slope. Slide initiated in a steep pocket showing that a little extra energy even in an isolated steep section among a lower angle slope can wake up the deep slab monster. Debris pile was 6-10' thick in the deepest parts and would have drug a caught skier through trees. Would have not been a pleasant rescue. Whole thing was a bit sobering and in retrospect we still feel good about the decision to ski in that area. This just brings to light how unstable the pack really is right now. Moving forward it is time to reassess what we consider ""low angle"".","","",""

On our 4th run, one of our party skied between the Goal Posts, toward the gully beneath Hanky Panky. The slide broke at his feet on the thin, rocky rollover and looked to have pulled up 150 feet and all the way across Hanky Panky to the far edge of the main Gulley. The slide came in two pieces, two clouds. The skier caught was one of the most experienced backcountry skiers at the Canyons and one of the best skiers. He managed to stay on top of the wash and was buried to his neck. Our party dug him out. He's fine. I went back up to inspect but getting to the crown at that time had too much exposure.

 

Additional info from the party: Myself and a group of 4 others were laping Dutches draw around 1:30pm. We had made several runs in a section called ""Hanky panky"", just north of ""movie line trees"". As we started migrating more and more skiers left I made the unfortunate decision to ski a line called ""goal post"". this line runs along a ridge that is more convex and becomes steeper, approaching 42 degrees in spots. My plan was to ski the right side of the subridge and avoid most the steeper more exposed section; giving me an escape route to skiers right. as I skied through the two trees that goal post is named after, I didn't notice any fracturing at the time but the snowpack was noticeably thin and faceted. Visibility was poor, but it is our belief that the avalanche started there in the weaker facets under the new snow, and quickly propagated and stepped down to the ground. It is important to note that the Avalanche didn't strike me like a NFL linebacker till I was 1/2 the way down the slope, leading me to believe that it didn't fracture till I was already well below the starting point. I made a number of mistakes and ignored some obvious red flags over the last couple days. Suspect pits, natural avalanches close by and on similar aspects, noted snow ""whomping"" and the UAC report, all should have been clear signals to back off. I'm just glad all ended well enough, and I had a great group of partners to dig me out.

Photo below shows where the skier entered the slope from a broad ridge roll. He skied between two trees called the goal post and triggered an avalanche. This avalanche then released a secondary and much larger piece of snow above and adjacent to him. He was caught, carried and buried up to his neck at the bottom. No injures.

The debris hit the flat transition at the bottom of the slope and abruptly came to a stop, piling the snow up to fifteen feet deep in places. Thankfully this all ended well and everyone was ok.

""Below is a photo from a northeast facing aspect near a ridgeline, on the crystal card a thin layer of facets and surface hoar are above a small crust. I am not sure how and when this crust formed but it seemed like a rime crust and I found it again a few days later at a similar elevation a few miles away on north side of the mountain. Anyway, on December 18th we received 3"" of very light snow that seemed to almost facet overnight.

We now have a rime crust on top of previous NSF with 3"" of stellars that faceted quickly.  Then on the night of December 19th we received an inch of snow with no wind and then another 2 inches on December 20th with no wind.  So this layer was well preserved."" Konignsberg

Then we received copious amounts of snow, wind and water on December 21st and 22nd followed by the Christmas day storm that brought 10 to 20 inches of low density snow.

The avalanche accident occurred the following day December 26th. Avalanche danger was rated considerable for North facing slopes above 9500 ft in elevation on that day. ","With all the action and recent avalanches outside the area boundary, it did not seem to stop people from exiting the resort to ride in the backcountry.   ","Our group decided it was too dangerous to ride onto the bed surface because of the hang fire and other people in the area still riding the adjacent slopes.

We decided to do a crown profile on a slope that avalanched naturally the night before (December 25th). This crown profile was done on nearly the same aspect and elevation as the skier triggered avalanche just around the corner (December 26th). "

A group of 3 skiers descended a steep, north-facing chute that goes by the local name ""Jaws"" in the upper section of Days Fork, Big Cottonwood Canyon of the Wasatch Range, Utah.  The first two skiers descended one at a time and tucked in beneath some cliffs in a safe spot at the bottom. When the third skier entered the slope, he triggered a large, deep avalanche that carried him down through rocks and small trees and completely buried him at the bottom.  He also suffered an open tibia-fibula fracture of his left leg with quite a bit of blood loss.  His partners, along another nearby group, who happened to see it from the flats below, quickly located him using avalanche transceivers and dug him out within 3-4 minutes.  He was not breathing and unconscious and he began breathing on his own after they cleared the airway.  He was evacuated by a medical helicopter.  He was buried with his face about a foot under the surface and his hand just under the surface as well. 

The skiers were very experienced, well-equipped locals in their 40's

 ","Jaws is a steep (40 degree plus) north-facing chute that goes through a narrow passage through a cliff and terminates in small fir trees at the bottom.  So it's high consequence terrain.   I took the upper photo from the ridge looking down.  It shows where the skiers entered the slidepath in the upper right of the photo and the skier who triggered the avalanche ended up in the small fir trees on the left of the photo.  I took the second photo from the bed surface of the avalanche looking down the avalanche path.  Rescuers had to carry the victim down to the landing zone in the flats below.   ","Typical of an early season snowpack, the base of the snowpack was depth hoar and the upper horizon of the faceted snow was very weak near-surface faceted snow that was on the surface before the latest storm.  This upper faceted layer was the weakest layer of the snowpack and it was probably the one that initially collapsed causing the avalanche, but the avalanche quickly stepped down to the depth hoar layer near the ground.  You can see distinct dirt streaks in the track.  A very large storm  with extremely high west wind over the previous days deposited a 2-foot-deep layer of very dense, moist snow, which was the slab in this case. Precipitation ended about 48 hours before the accident.  The day of the accident, there was mostly clear skies with increasing high clouds and warming temperatures in advance of another snowstorm.  ","","","",""

This time of year I enjoy walking up the west ridge of the Birthday Chutes to the summit of Red Top.  If need-be, a relatively safe descent can be made following the ridge and skinner back to the White Pine road.  There are a couple short, steep pitches one has to navigate before you get on the ridge that I thought would be manageable in the current danger.  We broke trail from the road and the shady snow was good.  Higher, we were skinning up the ridge on generally wind-hammered snow when, at the location of the X in the illustration, I had a crack shoot out from my skis.  I could see that the whole slope to my left had spiderwebbed, but not moved.  As we (party of two) were marveling at the collapse, we saw a powder cloud shoot out from the bottom of the westernmost Bday chute.  It had slid wall-to-wall, to the ground, basically removing the entirely of the snowpack from the length of the chute.  No other chutes slid to our knowledge. The collapse must have propagated 150-200 feet to cause this. The debris piles were large, with big chunks of windboard in it.  As usual, the strong SW winds were loading this slope and I suspect this made the danger locally higher.  In the illustration the blue line is our skinner, the red line outlines the collapsed area, and the red hash indicates areas that slid.  A large area that was probably near 30 deg didn't slide.  

One thing I have been thinking about since the seriously unstable snow last weekend is whether or not one can look at a spiderwebbed slope as being as safe as an avalanched one.  If the fracture has already propagated across it, can you cause an avalanche by then riding it?  My intuition says 99% of the time this is true.  But not 100%.  Is this proof that the slope is not steep enough to slide?  I am guessing that with these slides failing on the ground, the friction of the bed surface is relatively high, and just because the slope didn't totally fail this time, doesn't mean that with a smooth suncrust as a bed surface it might not slide then.  We took the most conservative route down to avoid testing these questions.  Even though we had no intention to ski the Bday chutes, it was still a good scare at the beginning of the season to keep one honest.  The phone was dying so we didn't get but one poor picture that I didn't attach.  Flat light made visibility difficult anyway.","","",""

We skinned up to sunset pass. Skier moved out onto north facing slope. It took only the her weight on the slope to cause around a 1000' propagation across the slope.

Debris ran approx 500ft onto the frozen lake below. We didnt get close to the crown but estimating it to be 3-4ft at most and ran to the ground. I'm guessing the avalanche occurred this morning as the debris was still fresh and no new/transported snow on the bedsurface.

I was surprised how far it ran with the low amount of snow we have but I think it started up high on NE facing wind loaded terrain that was holding old faceted snow from the previous storm, once it got out of the chute it hit the slick melt freeze crust that was present on the East facing right above the dirt and took all the new snow for a ride to the bottom. This slide was connected to more pockets that pulled out on the high NE facing chutes off the top of Cardiac Ridge, I'll put these smaller pockets in my observation. Photos full slide, debris looking up from the bottom, Crown, using the bed surface as a safe route up.

Got a better look at the Holey Toldeo slide from a few days ago. Very impressive avalanche that broke large 12"" + trees and produced a very deep debris pile.

From above, the surface looked as if sluffs from the cliffs above had deposited the surface snow without triggering anything larger, which we took as a good sign.  However, when we sent a skier down the cornice and into the upper couloir on belay, his weight immediately triggered a slab avalanche which propagated below him about 20 feet, and about 125 feet to the skier's right.  It did not propagate left, or above.  The avalanche wasn't very large since the slab was low density and only about 8 inches thick, and it did not break out very far below the crown, and it did not step down.  It did entrain a good deal of surface snow and ran the entire length of the couloir.  Since there was a lot of hangfire left, we opted to not ski the couloir and the slope tester climbed back up the rope.

It is my opinion that there were many slopes today at high elevation that could have produced similar results.  I also feel that they will remain sensitive tomorrow.  Additional snowfall will make them more active, and impossible to see. 

S winds were high in the morning, but by the time we were on the summit, they shifted around to the N, then died almost completely except for the odd gust.  There was, however, ample evidence of wind transport well down off the high ridges.

We found a way out lower down the ridge and got to see A LOT of steep snow.  Wind loaded snow was ubiquitous below the ridge lines, and in many gullies further down, although the ridges in between were scoured (cross loading) and that is what we used to exit safely.  Down lower, there was plenty of weak snow in the snowpack (old facets).  We had no choice but to ski cut many such slopes between 10,600 and 9600 on the way out, but found no significant slab overlying or stored energy so there were no signs of avalanche hazard in the non-wind affected terrain. 

The bottom line is that avalanche hazard was present primarily in wind loaded snow today.  It was relatively easy to deal with because you could see it, but new snowfall could obscure it and make tomorrow tricky.

There is video of the avalanche, but it isn't available tonight.  Hopefully tomorrow.","","",""

Notably, had felt as though there would be small micro-wind-slab pop due to increasing angle and slight slope buldge and wind loaded snow appearance and close proximity to rideg line.  Even with awareness of these factors, made decision to move across and ascend to ridge due to general stubornness, desire to attain pre-meditated goal, and probably most importantly, the general benign nature terrain below combined with confidence in my decision that what would pop, if anything. would be very small.

Skied down bed surface a bit and with my pal, Ferg, inspected the make up of this event.  Conclusions drawn on hill and now upon a half day's worth of reflection: the Thursday/Friday storm snow settled (heat and wind) and then the wind blew and it loaded.  Bingo.

Take aways: 1) Humbling. 2) Familiarity with slope/location/terrain, while nice in theory and conversation, invites error.  3) Minimizing the signs you see, say for the sake of getting somewhere (i.e. summit for a view) with a pal on a familiar slope, invites further error.  4) Overselling in one's mind the deep stabilty of spring, you guessed it, invites error.

I didn't notice or think about the fat pillows to the side of the run.  I originally planned to ski through the steep section very fast, but tagged a rock turning into the chute which triggered the instinct to put in a couple of hard turns to slow down.  It felt very good to get my avalung in my mouth and pop up with good visibility after tumbling a few times.

The avalanche problem that showed its face in this incident was well documented in other reports and in the advisory today, so I thought about not writing it up, but I think there is an additional good lesson to be learned from this particular incident. 


We started out at the Alta trailhead at 5:30 and skinned up to Superior. We estimated about 50-100 people were skinning up. we counted about 20 headlamps ahead and more than that behind, and it seemed that only half the people had their headlamps on as the snow made it bright enough with out them. Our objective was not the south face however, we were going to ski Monte Cristo. 

As we got to the top at 715, the wind was really blowing and transporting a good amount of snow. But today was the day to ski MC... and we didn't even want to think about skiing the south face with 50 other people. We skied the edge of the world line off the top of MC. I skied first. The snow was definitely wind affected, but mostly scoured as the wind was mainly out of the north. None of our group of 3 had ever skied MC and I was not sure exactly how to get into the the chute proper, so I slowed down a bit and traversed east towards superior. I crossed a couple small gullies. The second one instantly spidered under my feet. I kept moving and easily made it to the ridge 10 or so feet away. I looked back and the snow had fractured 20+feet above my track and 50 feet down the ridge along the gully. It then picked up a bit of speed and poured over cliffs and into MC gully where it was hard to see how far it went. I am guessing it went a good ways as it looked to still have a bit of speed as it went out of sight (maybe 800ft vertical).


The other 2 in my party and another party of 2 (making 5 ppl total) skied down to me. We all stood there for a bit looking above us at more windloaded terrain- some of which looked a bit thicker and harder. I was a bit shaken and we eventually decided to skin and boot back out, via the ""edge of the world"" line where there was a scoured strip of snow. 


The instability that we came across was new snow and thin soft windslab instability. Danger that I have always referred to as manageable. However, we were in hard to manage and unfamiliar terrain, making the danger less manageable or as we decided unmanageable. I was a bit shaken by the experience, and learned that manageable avalanche danger is only manageable in manageable terrain. 

picture 1: A windloaded sunrise - should have put up some red flags for us. 

picture 2: Edge of the World - more wind transport, we did think about this slope being scoured as a safe thing, but neglected to recognize that the slopes below would be loaded.

Two skiers were attempting to descend ""Mongo No"" when they triggered the slide.  They were able to claw into the bed surface and were not carried.  The debris took out tracks from another party that had skied below.  This route below the slide is a popular route coming out of the ""Room of Doom"" which I will descend occasionally.  It does point out that in the busy Wasatch, we need to pay attention to anyone who may be above us and think ""what if someone is up above me monkeying around""?

This is what we refer to as ""steep, radical terrain"" and is just the type of location you'd anticipate an avalanche when most of the terrain has a LOW danger.

The first 400 yds were safe, amazing, jaw dropping, face shots. Best turns of the year. We skied the spine before the trees force you into either the right or left gully, and we met just above in the safe zone.  
Next, I left first traversing the gully skier's right, to the next spine. I came over the roller and hit a rock just over the top popping off my right ski. At this point the entire surface of heavier, storm snow released and began to carry me and my ski down into the gully. I dropped onto my right hip as the slide picked up speed, exiting out the back of the slide. My right ski was carried downhill into the debris. 
Definitely not a big deal as slides go. Slow moving, shallow slide, but worth noting as so many other parties were in the area at the time. 
It could have been worse, certainly. Particularly had I been on the higher, steeper terrain of Superior proper, or above a drop.

This slope is concave (like the inside curve of a frying pan) and it looked like the grauple pooled at the transition zone creating a weak layer. How the slab became so connected and cohesive is the million dollar question?

My theory would be that the Hogum headwall must of seen a sustained period of wind, (15-30 mph) whether that wind blew up canyon or down canyon remains pure speculation, as I was a long ways out from this avalanche. It could of also been because of an intense precipitation spike during the storm as well. However, the avalanche looked fairly recent.  

Not sure if heat or settlement of the new snow had any role in slab formation, as it was still very cold on the north aspects when I noticed this avalanche. This was the only avalanched I observed in my travels today and really the only instability worth mentioning. 

I did take a step back and had to realize this was a big avalanche, I was surprised to see such a connected slab. I would put this avalanche in the unmanageable category. I did cautiously continue with my planned tour and had no troubles in any of the steeper north facing aprons. 

FORECASTER COMMENTS:  This most likely failed on a layer of graupel that rolled off the steeper slopes and pooled below.  We were finding areas with graupel pooling directly after the storm.  Most areas with pooling were not all that sensitive but it was noted in our travels.  Kobernik

Noorda and his brother Kevin are out for a day of riding. Late in the afternoon, they're headed back to their RV at the Bear River Trailhead and decide to play around on a popular slope in Gold Hill Basin. At approx 17:15 Ryan climbs a north facing slope and triggers a slide which breaks well above him as he's low on the slope. He's caught, carried, and consequently buried several feet deep on a benched terrain feature where the bulk of the debris stacks up. Kevin begins a beacon search, locates his brother, and begins CPR. About 20 minutes elapse when Kevin flags down a local rider and his son who assist in the rescue and notify local SAR. CPR continues for an additional 20 more minutes. While heroic efforts are made to save Ryan's life, medical crews pronounce him dead at the scene.



Debris stacked up deeply on this bench feature. Ted and Kevin Taylor from State Parks stand close to the tree that Ryan was located near.

 ","Gold Hill is a quick jaunt for local riders staging out of Bear River, however the terrain is far from straight-forward. As a matter of fact, it's quite complex and the sparsely spaced trees could give a rider a false sense of security. Steep, rocky terrain tends to promote a very weak snowpack.

This is a short, steep, slope averaging 38 degrees in steepness. Looking at an entry track and given the snowpack structure, we speculate the slide was triggered low on the path, on a portion of the slope nearing 36 degrees. The slab was connected to a steep portion of the slope above nearing 40 degrees in steepness.

This was the site of a close call on 3-25-13... http://utahavalanchecenter.org/sites/default/files/archive/advisory/prin...

","While the western Uinta's received early snow, sporadic storms and a dry spell from December into early January helped drive a strong temperature gradient, creating very weak basal snow. In addition, extremely cold temperatures lead to a snowpack with little to no structure. January 10th brought strong winds, heavy snow, and a widespread avalanche cycle with many slopes breaking deep and wide. A break in the action revealed an impressive avy cycle throughout the range, but many slopes remained intact. February 7th brought the next round of heavy snow, record water totals, and raging winds. 

The range has remained incredibly active since mid January. Historically large and destructive avalanches breaking to the ground have become the norm. While there have been many close calls, this relatively small avalanche combined with steep terrain resulted in a tragic accident.

A lot of folk out today looking at the debris from a close up viewpoint, I assume more details will trickle in.  My dimensions are a guess.

It was on a NE aspect ~35degrees at the start zone.  There were numerous other avalanches around that had been skier triggered. One in cardiff that ran around 9am and one in Toledo chute that ran around 1030am. I am assuming that both were intentionally triggered and hopefully the skier will post their own report. The Toledo Chute one was particularly impressive as both the main chute and the alternate chute lookers left both propagated wall to wall about 8-10 inches deep, it looked like from across the way.

About halfway down the ridge there is a cornice that is almost always there getting cross-loaded. And this specific area often runs. (see: http://utahavalanchecenter.org/avalanches/20524). 
 I pushed a small piece of the cornice off and it just slid 20 feet or so. So I jumped on the slab below the cornice doing a quick slope cut and skiing off the slab. The slope propagate ~100ft along the cornice and proceeded to run ~300ft down to just above the trees below. Looking at the bed surface there was a thin layer of grauple on top of about an inch of snow that had bonded well to the old hard melt freeze crust.  Looking at the crown there are two distinct layer of snow.

It was a Storm Slab/Wind Slab made more sensitive and cohesive as a result of wind loading. This was a Soft Slab of 4 finger hardness. It was a D2.5 in size. The victims' partner then proceeded to initiate another slide in the chute to the riders right of the aforementioned slide. He did not go for a ride. The total width of these two slides was approximately 350 feet, and the combined runouts were tied together as they came out of the cliff bands. This and many other slides appeared to have a weak layer that was just above the old snow interface, and it was a mixture of grauple and precip particles that had rimed stellars and light density snow. The initial snow that fell at the beginning of the latest event appeared to bond, yet after this first wave of high density/warm precip, there was a period when colder snow grains fell. At lower elevations, there was more grauple in the initial first 4 to 5 inches. Photos of this slide on the previous report by Kellen. His picture was better than mine.

Also observed was an 85 foot wide slide in the Chutes below the Wolverine Bowl. The riders right chute was also human triggered and it broke out approximately 100 feet/6 turns down the the slope. It was hard to tell if the victim went for a ride or was able to escape. It propagated as it descended just like all the other slides observed. As it broke out of the chute it propagated out below the cliff lines that form the chute. This slide as well as all others ran well into the flats...much longer that would be expected. It was approximately 12 to 14 inches deep and was a D1.5 in size.  

Slope cuts in the morning hours were yielding easy shears and fractures in the new snow only on slopes with angles > 35 degrees.

The good riding conditions experienced in the morning hours changed significantly after 1230 when there was an impulse that came through with Moderate to Strong Winds out of the SW; and this was accompanied with off and on precip, and Intense Blowing Snow. At that point the snowpack became upside down in almost all terrain, and this was exacerbated in any areas that were receiving even Light Winds. At least 5 naturals were observed in the Wolverine Cirque, with the Y Chute (aka Grannies) running in both nostrils. These were triggered by small cornice falls. And, this particular slide ran at least 150 feet on the low angle/flat moraine runout. After viewing this slide from the Peak of Wolverine an attempt was made to take a closer look at the crowns and possibly descend down the Y Chute. Due to rapid reloading and confirmation of the excessive nature of the runouts observed this mission was abandoned. Photos taken of this slide and the Wolverine Bowl slide were not of good quality due to the flat light, cloud cover and precip. 

During the last part of the afternoon there were extreme sensitivities observed on all aspects, with those receiving even limited wind loading exhibiting unusual highly sensitive results. These heightened conditions included terrain at mid elevations. Cracking was observed on 25 degree slopes with slab failures of one finger hardness on slopes of 30 degrees, and these avalanches were propagating around terrain features into adjoining gullies and chutes. 

Hazard in the mid to late afternoon escalated to High

"2/24/2014","Provo","Cascade Ridge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Just a quick note after noticing the observation of an avalanche on Cascade.  I saw the debris field that prompted the report, but I did not feel like the avalanche happened recently.  It was indeed very large and notable, but I assumed it happened back in the big February cycle.  To me, the debris shows no signs of being a recent large wet avalanche, such as large pieces of intact snow.   It is perfectly flat, like skiing on a glacier, except that rocks and branches are melting out of it so it looks like tornado aftermath. Also, there is no evidence of where the avalanche came from.  I walked up the deposition and the slide path all the way to the summit ridge without seeing any signs of large avalanches in the last couple of weeks, certainly no wet slabs of that magnitude.  I've seen some very large wet avalanches down here, and I don't think they fan out large enough to create this kind of debris field.  In my experience, they tend to channel and pile up deep.  This avalanche had none of those hallmarks.  I strongly believe that this avalanche occurred at least 2 months ago.

The reason I bring it up is because I think things are very stable down here currently, and I think the the implication that this occurred last week gives the wrong impression.  

It is also interesting to me because I could certainly be wrong in my conclusions about it, and I'd like to know if I've missed something.  So I'm curious if there is any more information from other sources about it.  Perhaps the powder birds (it's at the bottom of one of their runs) or UDOT would have some insight about timing?  I'm definitely open to being wrong about this, and would appreciate knowing if I am.

A small geographic note about that observation: this avalanche is a couple of miles away from the Big Springs/Shingle Mill ridgeline.  It is actually on the ridge that separates Big Springs from Bunnells, but the avalanche was completely contained in the Big Springs drainage (which is quite large and at that elevation is comprised of 4-5 (depending on how you count) separate basins.

If you want some good pictures of a large destructive avalanche for a slide show, this is a pretty good one!  The source and timing may be a mystery, but the destruction is legit!

Forecaster comments:
I tentatively listed the occurrence date as the 20th but the exact date may be different.  From looking at the photo, it could be that a glide avalanche triggered the slab on the looker's left of the photo.  From the angle of the photo I can't tell whether the right side of the avalanche was connected to the rest of it.  But those steep rock slabs in Broad's Fork are always sketchy terrain where glide avalanches are common and deep slabs are more common than the rest of the range.  It would be nice to get in there and have a look at it.  Tremper","","",""

Anyway, it looks like it broke near the ridge on the right half of the photo included here and was an estimated 2-4 feet deep and perhaps 200' wide.

Forecaster Comments:
I was in the area today and went to look at the slide as well.  I concur that it probably occurred yesterday because there was very little new snow on the wind protected sections.  I did not feel like it was safe to get to the fracture line but it was obvious what it was running on--the weak faceted snow near the ground and in some areas, it looked like weak faceted snow above a crust.  I would say the deepest areas were more like 4 or 5 feet but averaged 3 feet.  There are many other slopes in the area that are identical that have not avalanched.  Spooky.  Thanks for all your hard work, Mark -  Bruce Tremper

Forecaster comment- Ted found this large natural during his travels in Whitney Basin on Mon. Feb. 17. We tried to pinpoint when it possibly occurred. Westerly winds have dominated since the very active zonal pattern developed in early January. This pattern tends to strip snow from Superbowl. However, looking back at Windy Peak wx data, southwest winds made their first appearance late in the evening of the 15th and blew into the 40's and 50's for 13 hours, essentially sealing the fate for a very weak, fragile snowpack. 

Ted Scroggin knows the Uinta's like no one else and is a valuable member of the Utah Avalanche Center. Many thanks to Ted for having the intuition to sniff this one out... does this guy rock or what?

I heard about the avalanche when I was returning from Cardiff Fork to Alta and went to take a look at it.  Brighton noticed the avalanche in the morning and used a helicopter to search the debris with a long range beacon.  They noticed a single track coming up from the bottom and the debris covered that track.  They could not locate any exit track.  But there was no beacon signal in the debris.  Although the party reported it to Alta Central, Brighton did not get the word that it was triggered from the top.

In talking with Brighton, we were both concerned that we did not see an exit track.  I tried to enter the debris from the north side but it was too sketchy.  I pulled back and went in from the top, which was steep and rocky but doable.  I searched the debris and found no beacon signal and noticed an exit track in the trees that was not visible to the helicopter.  So I declared the debris was cleared.

The avalanche was a deep slab 4-5 feet deep, 200' wide and it was a hard slab that ran on faceted snow just above the rain-rime crust.  There was more depth hoar beneath the crust.

Here is an overview of the crown from below.  It's much larger than it appears from the ridge.  It ran to the faceted snow just above the rain-rime crust.  

Looking down the slidepath.  The single up track was buried by the debris down in the trees and the track exited to the upper right of this photo in the trees, where it was not as visible to the helicopter.

Here is the single up track I could see from the side of the avalanche, which was buried by debris just above the photo.  There was too much dangerous terrain between me and the slide so I backed off and went up to the ridge to get onto the bed surface to search the debris.

It's the first main slide path that comes in from the west as you head up from the archery range. Lots of broken shrubs -- cleared nearly all the brush out and looks like it stopped a few hundred yards below the trail. From the amount / location of the broken brush, I expect this slid from the top -- but didn't see a crown and didn't have a good view of the starting zone. Also, at least a foot+ of fresh snow on top of the debris and relatively smooth. Hard to tell how long ago this slid -- could be 1 or 2 or 3 cycles ago. No other recent tracks on the trail except moose.

Forecaster comments:
I took additional photos on February 15th.  The avalanche broke from Cardiac Pass to the steep rock slabs down canyon.  Total width was estimated to be 1000' with a fracture depth estimated to be 5-6 feet.  As it descended, it pulled out the lower slopes on Little Superior down by the bottom of the basin at about the same depth and width.  I did not get to examine the fracture line but it was obvious from looking at it that it was a deep slab running on the weak depth hoar and faceted snow layers deep in the snowpack.

At Cardiff pass, after lengthy discussions about route choice, we decided to climb the west ridge of Toledo. On the way up we observed numerous natural and explosively triggered slab avalanches in the ivory flakes/Montreal hill area. Cardiac appeared to have a few debris piles as well but our view was obscured by clouds. Our intention was to ski the Toledo chute. We knew it had avalanched during the storm and all three agreed that the avalanche danger in the chute would be manageable. With my two partners watching from safe locations, I made a ski cut from south to north across the rollover. No result. There was only about 6 inches of snow on a firm bed surface. I dropped in from the trees on the left side and made two turns before it popped. As soon as I saw the snow start moving, I could hear my partners yelling a warning. I cut left into a safe zone and grabbed a tree, unfortunately dropping my poles in the process. The chute went wall to wall at the top but only a few inches deep. The avalanche itself was probably d1 r1-2 and petered out pretty quickly. I skied out to the bottom, unsuccessfully searching for my poles on the way down. My partners ended up opting for the sparse trees between Toledo chute and the bowl proper.

I'm feeling worse about dropping my poles than anything else at this point. We were all expecting the line to avalanche and, as a group, I think we managed that risk well. Sorry for the lack of pics, clouds were in and out at that point. If anybody finds my poles I'd love to get them back.

COMMENTS FROM ANDY:

We went up to do an AM lap on Toledo but didn't like the skinner up there- more evidence of deposition than we had hoped for and its hard to really not be in some kind of avalanche terrain if you approach up the bowl- so we spun and instead headed up Flagstaff. As we headed up the ridge 3 folks appeared on top of Toledo Chute. Not sure how they got there- perhaps from Flagstaff, but definitely not from the south approach- we had just come from there putting the track in part way and bailing and nobody had followed us. Anyway it seemed like a bold line for the conditions so we stopped to watch- I took video but the light is bad and its hard to see anything so won't even bother posting. They put in a couple of good ski cuts and then somebody dropped in as though he (she?) would ski it, but with a conservative approach to it he managed to ski right off to the side when the whole thing ripped. Good enough exit seemed like it was probably intentional. Again hard to tell details from across the way so guessing a bit on the dimensions, hardness, problem, etc. but it seemed like it went pretty much wall to wall, soft wind slab, perhaps 50 cm deep?, running 500'?, size D1.5-2?, starting zone in there must be around 40 degrees. After waiting a minute, the skier uneventfully skied down the track/debris. The remaining 2 skiers traversed over to Toledo Bowl and skied uneventfully. On our exit down the S ridge of Flagstaff I managed to pop out a wind slab that was only ~8"" deep and ran ~75' downhill, but propagated ~100'.

Forecaster Comments:  

Backcountry skiers intentionally triggered a large cornice that rolled to the lower part of the slope and triggered a very large avalanche in West Monitor that took out the entire season's snowpack to the ground.  Here are comments from the skiers who triggered it:

After making sure no people were in the run a friend and I kicked off a truck size cornice while on belay. The cornice ran down to the bottom of the bowl and triggered a very large avalanche once it reached the bottom. The avalanche broke all the way to the ground and ran full track.

Regardless of the trigger, the ""West"" slide is significant just due to how rare it is for this slope to slide.  The 1F hard slab pulled out to the ground, leaving huge refrigerator sized chunks littered across the slope.  This slope is just a hundred yards or so due south of the weather station on a northerly, treed slope.

The crown averaged 4 feet but was up nearly 6 feet in some spots.  It failed just 6-10"" above the ground on basal facets/depth hoar.  It appears that the failure layer was just above or below a very thin rime crust (date of crust unknown).  

Slope angle was mostly 32-34 degrees along the starting zone, but did have a small area as steep as 40 degrees.  There was lots of crevasse-like cracking on the adjacent lower angle terrain.  This is not a slope that I would typically expect to see an avalanche on, much less one this deep sliding to the ground.  It really got our attention.
","","","This is the ""East"" slide, reported by Bill Brandt on 2/9.  It is just a couple hundred feet from the other ""West"" slide.  It is much bigger than the ""West"" slide.  This slide is also significant in my opinion as it moved an enormous amount of snow, snapped some trees and pasted snow on the uphill side of the trees another 6-8 feet above the top of the debris.

I thought it was somewhat interesting that these two slides did not connect together.  The snow left in between them is of the same aspect and slope angle.  The only thing anchoring this piece of snow in place may be the closely spaced trees."

Media reports- http://www.4utah.com/story/d/story/man-dies-in-avalanche-near-huntington...

​Preliminary information:
It was a party of four experienced snowmobilers, all with rescue gear.  Some of the snowmobilers became stuck and one person circled uphill and to the side of them to come help.  He triggered the avalanche that buried him but the avalanche did not catch the stuck snowmobilers.  They other snowmobilers began rescue efforts immediately but the victim was buried 6-8 feet deep and it took 20 minutes to extricate him.  They began CPR but he did not respond.

The victim was Clinton Conover of Ferron, Utah.  Everyone at the Utah Avalanche Center's hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim of this tragic accident.



Clinton was found just uphill of his sled,



Many thanks to Larry and Jonathan from Utah State Parks. While Cody and I investigated the avalanche, these guys probed for the sled, found it, and we all teamed up to dig it out and ultimately, get it back to family members.","





Not the typical big terrain that makes up much of the Manti-Skyline. This was a small, mostly wind protected bowl with well spaced conifers.","The Manti-Skyline has just been on the southern fringes of a storm track that hasn't been favorable to the region. Very shallow snow grew weak and sugary through the early part of January. The region received it's first real shot of snow, water, and wind on Jan. 10th-12th. In between impulses, a raincrust formed on Jan 11th. More storminess followed and and a widespread avalanche cycle ensued. A vigorous storm system moved into the region on Friday Feb. 7th-9th, An Avalanche Warning was issued, and the region experienced an extensive natural avalanche cycle.

This fatal avalanche failed on facets below the Jan 11th raincrust. The slab was well connected and the crust allowed the the snow to move at an unusually high rate of speed as it descended the relatively short slope.","This isn't big avalanche terrain. As a matter of fact, this group did everything right by avoiding big slopes. Unfortunately, the Skyline snowpack is atypically weak and thin for this time of year and this structure is producing unusual avalanches.

Investigated an unreported avalanche with significant debris.  Although slope is relatively small it ends in a terrain trap with many trees.
Upon investigation looked as if a solo skier was traversing underneath a steep slope when he triggered a large slab that ran on the Jan. 10th rain crust.  There was one track in and one track out so it look as if skier miraculously was able to ski off of the slab.  If he had been caught a full burial would have been likely.
Of note, the skier triggered avalanche looks to be responsible for a sympathetic release around the corner off of the same ridge.  The sympathetic avalanche was just as large and also ran on the rain crust on a more northeast aspect.  A large area of undisturbed snow in between the two avalanches.  More proof that the weak layer, slab, and bed surface (rain crust) is continuous and well connected.

It is the steep ridge between powder park (3?) and the Desolation Lake drainage.  I would identify it precisely on google maps except I am unable to zoom to accurately indicate the slide's location.  I have tried 3 different computers and I'm giving up.  Anyway, the avalalanche is BIG; probably a  thousand feet wide, give or take.  The Eastern extremity is a well defined crown just below the West ""summit"" of the ridge feature and the fracture continues West and down to the Western extremity of the ridge.  It wraps around sub-ridges and connects slopes most people might consider ""unconnected"".  We did not investigate closely, but it ran full track, started as (at least) all the storm snow, and appeared to step down into older snow.  This is the same slope that killed Alan Murphy's brother in-law back in the early 80s.  

Observation time was 5:00 pm. Based on this statement: "" Interestingly, no natural activity observed above Desolation Lake and West Desolation Ridge, which both have similar aspects to Sheep Sh!t Ridge -- perhaps not as much wind exposure in these locations?""  made by SD earlier the same day, we might suppose this slide occured mid to late afternoon.  It certainly looked as ""fresh as a daisy"".  No camera, no pic.

Note: Seth Dromgoole emailed the following comments:
Just wanted to respond to Fred's Avy Observation of West Desolation and my Avy Obs of Sheep Shit Ridge (I'm SD) on 2/9/14.  I had noted in my Obs that I didn't see slides in Deso or West Deso -- I was in the area around 3-3:30 pm.  Fred stated he saw the slide around 5 pm.  The slide must have occurred in the 1.5 hr gap.  Of note, when I was scanning that area I did notice a lone skier skinning along the ridge between Deso and West Deso, perhaps that skier triggered the slide?","","",""

She had no pulse when she was recovered but it was reported they may have recovered a pulse either in transport or at the hospital. Media report that she passed away today, February 9th.  Our hearts go out to the family and friends with this especially tragic accident.","It was a steep gully with a stream at the bottom.  The avalanche descended just a short distance of about 125 feet into a creek, where the woman was buried face first in the water.  The Tibble Fork Resivoir area is a popular destination and trailhead and most of the terrain in the immediate area is fairly gentle.  But this particular, steep gully is between the reservoir and the main parking lot, just north of the road.  The site of the burial was only about 200 feet off the road.  These steep gullies are what we call 'terrain traps' because if an avalanche occurs, the snow and anyone caught has nowhere to go and ends up 'trapped' very deep at the bottom of the gully.  In this particular case, if the party would have walked on the north side of the creek, they would not have been caught even if an avalanche did occur.","The largest snow storm of the winter deposited over a couple feet of new snow at higher elevations but at 6,400' it was a mix of rain and snow as the rain-snow line was rising all day.  It was difficult to determine the exact weak layer due to very warm temperatures which had made the snow completely saturated on the day of the investigation.  A foot or more of old weak faceted snow was still present below the bed surface.  The bed surface was collapsing on the wet facets below which made the situation unsafe to do a complete investigation.

The avalanche appeared as a storm slab which contained snow from the most recent storm.  It may have broke just above a rain crust that formed January 29th.","We have not talked with anyone that was present when the accident happened so we are unsure about a number of things.  All of our information is from Search and Rescue teams or Lone Peak Fire who responded to the accident.

Below are comments about the accident which are based on my opinion.

I believe this was a case of 'innocent ignorance' as I suspect no one in the party had any idea that they were in avalanche terrain.  This is not to say they are stupid, just unaware.  It is easy to think this way with the avalanche site so close to the road.  However, all you need is a steep enough slope with snow on it and you're in avalanche terrain, no matter how close to a road or civilization you are.

I regularly spend time doing field work in the Provo area mountains and it is not uncommon to see snowshoers or snowshoe tracks in the bottom of gullies.  Many of these gullies are fairly small and seem unassuming to someone who has no avalanche education.  Also, they are often the path of least resistance for traveling so it is understandable why we see people in these gullied 'terrain traps'.

There was 2 feet of dense snow combined with wind and rising temperature, which triggered a number of natural avalanches in the area including this one.

","","","Most of the day we experienced surprisingly long durations of high PI rates causing us to amend our plan and choose less exposed terrain.  As the new snow began to accumulate we began to easily initiate small LS slides in steep terrain and chose to scale things back.  We carefully chose our route and used more protected areas but we failed to recognize a small hanging pocket that was difficult to see.  The Jan 29-30 storm deposited about 12"" @ 1.45""H2O in the upper elevations of the Southern Wasatch.  Like elsewhere in the range, the initial part of the storm came in warm and bonded well to the old surface.  A density change within the new snow was responsible for numerous LS-N-D2's in the Provo area during the storm.  On the night of Jan 31, partial clearing led to the beginnings of a NSF layer that was quickly buried by another 3"" during the day today.  It is unclear if this layer contributed to the latest round of LS slides today but it was easy to identify in our pits and also reactive to easy taps with the shovel tilt test.

While our incident today did not have major consequences, it seems likely if the terrain was more complex this type of slide could have been much more serious."

We postulate that it failed on a depth hoar layer that we had identified on similar slopes/aspects near rocks and logs. It failed as a large hard slab first, running a couple hundred feet, and then failing again, as the crown propagated further along the sub-ridge. Images were poor quality as it was snowing hard.

Looked at Scotts peak then decided to look into No Name because we new that was the place with the weakest snow structure, did not note any new activity in the bowl, dropped a few small cornices and only got some shallow new snow sluffs to run. Walked around the corner into the trees and dug a pit, the pit showed only 4 inches of new low density snow sitting on a fragile rain crust, with no slab just loose facets. Went back around the corner to No Name with the intentions of skiing it, noting not much of a new load or any wind effect and new the slope contained basically facets top to bottom with minimal amount or new snow. Brett went in first and noted a little bit if a slab in the very top section but 2 turns in he was in loose facets top to bottom with no slab, he skied the slope without incident. I dropped in next and made what I think was a mistake in judgment, instead of skiing to the skiers right of his tracks which was a bit lower angle, I opted for the steeper roll on skiers left side about 30ft down the slope I saw it fracture about 20ft above me and turned hard right and got off the slab, the slide washed by me and gouged down to the ground running to the transition zone and leaving a nice debris pile at the bottom. Fracture line was 5 to 11"" deep.  My thinking is that I hit a thin weak spot in the only place on the whole slope with a small slab on it, and the debris pile was so large because it cleaned out all the hang fire from the last slide I triggered in there a couple weeks ago, and cleaned out all the facets to the ground in the whole path except for the top of the starting zone. It was actually some what of a user friendly slide if that is possible. I think I hit the only sweet spot in the whole bowl that you could trigger an avalanche in. The words spacial variability, and pockety come in mind when i think about it. Traveled all the way to Mill D from there with no other activity noted.

FORECASTER COMMENTS:  As we started the day, we anticipated a significant danger and had no intentions of skiing No Name.  However, it quickly became apparent the storm didn't produce as expected and conditions were less dangerous.  We were finding 4 to 5 inches of loose new snow, very little wind effect.  We decided the loose new snow sitting on the old loose facets was not a dangerous situation.  This was the case.  However, we underestimated the amount of new snow that had drifted enough to produce the pocket that Mark triggered.  The pocket itself was not all that scary, basically a moderate sized drift.  However, what we both noted was the large pile of debris formed from the initial slab gouging into facets and entraining snow as it traveled all the way down the slope.  As Mark noted, this situation is not all that likely right now.  Most areas just didn't get the load.  Mark and I have a good amount of experience and it should be noted that we made an error in judgment here.  Ultimately, not a significant event but any avalanche unintentionally triggered while you're on the slope is too many. - Kobernik

The lower more significant rime crust that formed on Jan 11 was still intact below the bed surface. It did not travel far, only running to the first transition in slope angle but if the slope was bigger I think it would easily have run farther.  
","","","In general the new load of about 1"" of water was not enough to tip the scales in most of the areas traveled today.  I expected a bit more wind effect along the ridges but was surprised to see very little.  This storm was a nice little refresh for the ski conditions, at least above about 8200' or so.  Below this, the very hollow faceted snowpack was saturated from yesterday's rain and was less than supportable unless you were moving quickly.  I suspect that steep terrain below 8500' has the potential to gouge completely to the ground.  It looks like this could be short lived however as the temps are forecast to drop significantly."

Snow conditions continue to get weaker as the snow continues to facet, shaded areas have surface hoar, and weak snow to the ground on aspects from east to north west. We will be in for another round of avalanches if we get more snow next week.

FORECASTER NOTE:  It appears that this path was reloaded by the wind after the initial avalanche which happened last week.  It is quite possible this was triggered by the snowmobiler who made the track that the avalanche covered up.  Kobernik

I could see a limited number of fresh point release/small rollers & a single short avalanche with minimal entrainment in Burnt Hollow around 8200'.

It felt like 45 degrees and I assume that all of these were influenced by local terrain greenhouse effects.

There is limited leeward drifting on the west-aspect ridges.  Although one area around 9000' had released a small patch,  probably with Saturday's afternoon heating.

There were a couple of large rollers next to the trail just North of Second Right Hand Fork Overlook.  They predated the last snowstorm.  West

He caused a lower slab to go which started small but then the lower slab caused all of the upper to go including the cornice.  We observed other large bowls with no snowmobile tracks in or out that had gone. This was only one of multiple avalanches we either triggered or observed. The 2nd and 3rd picture is an avalanche that ww triggered remotely from our snowmobiles. We were riding around 40 yards from where the slide actually occurred.  That one slid down to the weeds and covered the trail we had just ridden in on with about 7ft of snow.  Some occurred naturally and others from snowmobiles.  Both obvious and non obvious hills were sliding down to the dirt. In both cases I think the wind was a major factor in that the cornices were huge and the wind had blown large amounts of unstable snow below those cornices.  I believe that the first picture of the bigger slide is the tallest peak in that range so I'm guessing around 10k ft. In all cases we observed the slides went from the ridgeline all the way down.

The snow and winds started Saturday evening and didn't stop until Monday morning/early afternoon, and for a good portion of this multi-day storm the snow fell as graupel. Visibility was less than 1/4 mile. We stuck to low-angle slopes near Chicken Hill and White Pine Knob, and on Sunday the storm snow was pretty consistent and super fast. Sunday afternoon at about 4:45 pm we skied the ridge off the south side of the Knob, taking care to avoid the gut to skier's left. Partway down the ridge visibility cleared enough that we could see a 2-3' crown in the center/top of the Knob's southeast-facing gut. The slide was about 75' wide and traveled about 200' with mostly 2' chunks in the debris (which we couldn't see until Monday). It's possible that we triggered it remotely from the top of the Knob - we did hear several collapses during our hike - but because it looked like there was some new snow on top of the bed, we thought it was probably a natural slide.

Shawn knew of the high avalanche danger and believed they would stay in safe terrain. He even told his wife they would be safe. They were the first sleds up having to break trail and noted that the snow seemed ""funky."" They stopped at one point and felt ""the snow shift."" (Most likely they experienced a collapse.)

Shawn and Hunter entered the runout zone of the Fairgrounds and traveled across to and over a small sub-ridge that divides the Fairgrounds and the Rodeo Grounds. As they began their descent into the Rodeo Grounds,  they triggered an avalanche and Shawn communicated to his son to ""go, go, go."" Both managed to outrun the slide. They circled around and waited for Weston but he never came over. After a minute or two, they headed back over the sub-ridge and saw that the entire Fairgrounds had slid. There was no visible sign of Weston. Shawn and Hunter went to the middle of the slide and looked around for any signs but saw nothing. They searched for 5-10 minutes in the area before Shawn decided to head farther down the deposition. When he approached the toe he saw a snowmobile ski sticking out of the snow. He immediately began searching for surface clues. About 20 feet uphill of the sled he saw 4 fingers of a red glove. He felt fingers in the glove and began to dig furiously. 

Shawn did not have a shovel (the only shovel in the party was buried with Weston) so he dug with his bare hands (his fingers began to bleed). Hunter came down a few minutes later and broke off some branches to use to dig. Shawn and Hunter dug for about 5 minutes and finally cleared snow from Weston's face. He was blue and likely not breathing. Shawn managed to get Weston's goggles and nose protector off and ""blow into his mouth."" After a few breaths, Weston responded and began breathing again. (He was buried for approximately 15-20 minutes. His full face type helmet likely gave him a small air pocket.) Shawn and Hunter continued to dig Weston out for another 30 minutes. He did not have any major injuries so Shawn loaded him on his sled, returned to the trailhead, and drove straight to the hospital. Weston was treated for hypothermia and a strained neck and released that evening.

Weston had gotten stuck in the bottomless snow and was digging his sled out when the avalanche occurred. He had actually just cleaned his goggles and put them back on when he looked up and saw the avalanche coming. He said at first he didn't understand what was happening as he was out of sight of the actual slide path. When he realized he was going to get swallowed he tried to run for the trees to his left (skier's right). He was buried about 10 feet from the edge of the deposition. 

A few things that may have saved his life:

1. He was very close to the end of the deposition so it was not as deep as higher up and was also slowing down as it approached him.

2. He chose to dive to the inside of a curve. The deposition directly across from him was much deeper.

3. He forgot his gloves at the gas station so his dad gave him his pair of brand new red gloves. The red really stood out against the snow.

All three are aware of how lucky they were and that having had a beacon would have made a huge difference in the amount of time Weston was buried. They shared their experience hoping that it would prevent another accident like theirs from occurring again. 

None of them had ever received any formal avalanche education training. 

 ","The avalanche in the Fair Grounds occurred on the steep east face of 9700' Logan Peak, due east of Logan Utah in the Bear River Range.  The very broad slope faces east and east southeast.  I measured a slope angle of less than 35 degrees in some areas high on the slope and beneath crown.  But there is much steeper mid-slope roll with gullies and rock outcroppings where the slope angle tops 45 degrees in places.  The avalanche included, and was likely triggered from a connected slope, the Rodeo Grounds.  The lower angled upper slopes fractured but did not run.        The alpha angle, or angle from Crown to Toe, was around 21 degrees and actually, this avalanche path has a history of running a good distance further.  ","---When the accident occurred it was a windy day, with fairly strong northwest wind, periods of graupel and snow showers, and poor visibility at upper elevations and at the accident site.

A dry end to the 2013 year and a series of prolonged high pressure systems over the area left a shallow and exceptionally weak snowpack across the Bear River Range.  We observed widespread deep and very loose sugary or faceted snow on most upper elevation slopes in the Logan Forecast Zone, including terrain fairly near the accident site in Providence Canyon.   A prolonged moist and windy series of storms affected the Logan Zone, with 4.8 inches of water in a couple feet of snow recorded at the 8400' Tony Grove Snotel, several miles north of Logan Peak  between 1-8-2014 and the time of the accident on 1-13-2014.  Sustained and very strong westerly winds were recorded between January 8 and 13 at the UDOT Logan Summit weather station to the north and on Mt. Ogden to the south, but riming of the wind sensor likely skewed the readings at the Logan Peak weather station at the summit communications tower within about a hundred feet of the avalanche.","From Z-bros on 1-13-2014:   Guys be careful out there be aware of the conditions and watch for the signs. This was another large slide in the same place it always seems to slide. It started in the Fair grounds breaking at the top and wrapping all the way around into the Rodeo grounds. The individual caught up in this slide was very lucky and at last report is home and doing well.

 
","The buried rider was in a party of three. He was off his sled when the avalanche occurred and tried to run for the trees to the side. He was buried about 20-30 feet away from his sled which was also buried. He had no beacon.  Fingers of his borrowed red glove were visible protruding from the snow enabling his father and brother to dig him out with their hands and gathered branches. He needed to be resuscitated but had no other significant injuries. The party of three got down on two sleds and immediately drove the victim to the hospital.  He was released and returned home.  Toby Weed, Paige Pagnucco, and Brett Kobernik of the Utah Avalanche Center visited the site on 1-14-2014.","","Media Stories from 1-14-2014:

The third and fourth riders were behind and did not witness the triggering, but arrived on the scene as the avalanche was still moving.  They rapidly descended the rocky avalanche path, one on his sled, the other on foot, and quickly found and honed in on the buried rider's beacon signal near his exposed sled and got a positive probe strike. The two rapidly unburied their partner who was buried under 1 to 2 feet of debris about 20 feet south, across the hill and slightly above the sled.   Matthew was initially unresponsive, and not apparently breathing, with blue colored lips.  As snow was cleared away from his chest, breathing returned and the rescued rider regained consciousness.  As they continued the excavation, the two rescuers quickly realized that he was seriously injured, with multiple broken bones.    As is common with most avalanche survivors, and in the midst of a serious and intensifying winter storm, hypothermia quickly became the priority issue. 

Luckily, the second rider, who had stopped his sled just above the crown, had intermittent cell phone service and was able to call for help.  The 911 call was dropped dozens of times. Rescue Helicopters attemped to respond from both the north and south but were turned back due to fowl and worsening weather.    County search and rescue ground teams from both sides of the state line responded.   When I arrived at the scene, shortly before 7:00 PM, SAR teams from Cache County, Franklin County, and Bear Lake were affecting a difficult and time consuming rescue in the worst possible weather conditions.  Due to the remoteness of the avalanche and to avoid further avalanche risk to rescuers, the injured rider had to be rope-hauled by hand up the slope.   Around 1400' of rope was employed, with dozens of rescuers hauling from above, as a smaller party provided first aid and helped move the litter.  Rescuers moved the litter to a snowcat, which then punched through horrendous conditions.  The Cache Country SAR team and the injured rider arrived at the ALS ambulance at the Beaver Creek trailhead at around 10:00 PM

 

 

 ","The avalanche occurred on a east facing upper elevation slope near the high crest of the Northern Bear River Range. Strong west winds in the past few days drifted snow into the lee slope deceleration zone.  The convex slope rolls over steeply to around 38 degrees near the rocky probable trigger location, but is sustained at a lower 35 degree pitch for much of the slope.  The avalanche propagated to the south at least a quarter mile into a steep cirque, pulling out a huge and well connected hard slab. 

The picture is a Google Earth screenshot view from the east, with the point near the middle of the crown at the top of the avalanche.  I measured the alpha angle, (angle from crown to toe) of this slide at 22.5 degrees.","A dry end to the 2013 year and a series of prolonged high pressure systems over the area left a shallow and exceptionally weak snowpack across the Bear River Range.  We observed widespread deep and very loose sugary or faceted snow on most upper elevation slopes in the Logan Forecast Zone, including terrain just a few miles south of the accident site.  

In the last few days leading up to Saturday's accident a series of gradually more moist and very windy storms created a cohesive slab on the weak preexisting snow.   Here was my current conditions report for the morning of 1-11-2014:  

The Tony Grove Snotel at 8400' reports close to two feet of new snow in the last 48 hours, containing 1.9 inches of water. It's a balmy 28 degrees this morning, and there is 49 inches of total snow containing 77% of average water content for the date. I am reading more reasonable west winds this morning at the UDOT Hwy 89 Logan Summit wind sensor, after sustained high winds for several hours yesterday, with 40+ mph average west winds and gusts close to 60 mph. The 9700' Logan Peak weather station reports 23 degrees, and southwest winds in the upper teens. Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, with drifted and inverted heavy new snow, difficult trailbreaking, and safe riding limited to lower angled meadows and packed trails. The heavy new snow is being drifted onto slopes with widespread very weak preexisting sugary or faceted snow.

The weather was fairly extreme during the rescue operation as I remember it, with heavy snowfall, graupel, very strong west winds and drifting snow causing full-on whiteout conditions... Photos below somewhat obscured by drifting snow.","Stories of the accident are now well circulated on various media.  Salt Lake TV station KSL's story........ HERE

REPORT:

This morning 01.10.13 we hiked up to the backside via the bomb trail. There was good coverage most of the way but also an unfortunate tortilla-like, easily breakable sliver of ice on the ungroomed snow surface. The groomers were icy too. The only stellar snow was in the trees fairly high on the frontside slope (above 8000 ft.). Once over the top we descended 50-100 feet and on a Northern to NE aspect which was 25 degrees approximately we dug a pit. There is a very reactive layer right now about 8in. in depth. The column tests failed early, quickly, and in a alarming planar manner. With snow and especially wind set to arrive later today/tomorrow, please be careful out there. I wouldn't be surprised to hear of slides occurring. We saw Ryan Butterfield on our descent so maybe someone should check in on him. He was alone. Here are the stats:

General observations: 

The snow pack was 85 cm were we dug. We were just south/sw of the llama. The slope was about 25 degrees facing NE. The wind was blowing from the south/sw at a good clip. I didn't have a gage but the weather reports says 25 mph. There were several faceted layers: The first was about 8cm from the surface and the second was near the bed surface approximately 55 cm in depth.
 

Column test:

CT1 Q1 The strength of the identified layer (about 8cm deep) was super weak. The column collapsed very easily (immediately) on a faceted layer..maybe buried surface hoar. When I continued the column test the next failure occurred at CT12. We did not determine the quality of the shear as it occurred on the ground

 

Extended column test:
ECT1 Q1. Alarming failure. Reactive. Fracture extend 60cm laterally (i.e., the whole column--see image attached). This was the same layer as discussed above.  When I continued the test, no further failures were noted

We decided that we felt safe moving along the lower-angle shoulder, expected the possibility of manageable avalanching, and ensured there was no one below before ski-cutting our shoulder.  After a few cuts and during some safe-spot to safe-spot skiing one of our skiers (third to ski the slope) triggered and skied off a pocket on the more westerly slope of the shoulder that popped ~50' wide x18"" deep and ran ~200' downslope.

Both ran near the ground on old November facets (buried deep) and left evidence in their bed surface of the buried dirt layer from earlier this fall.  No one was caught in either slide and our party felt confident with the decisions we had made and the results of our actions.

All had listen to the mornings Avalanche report and were knowledgeable about yesterdays and last weeks condition, all had shovels, beacons, avalungs. We observed the upper portion of the bowl Thursday and saw that there had been several ski track through it. As we ascended to the ridge we observed three other skier skiing to the west and down to the road, starting at around 35 degrees, but becoming more gradual. As we reached the point of the upper bowl we decided to do some ski cuts, we did two to the east and 2 to the west, skiing one at a time and to a protected spot. It was determined unstable and the skier at the top was advised not to drop in. I was low enough on the ridge that I made a quick ski cut to what appeared to be a less steep pitch. As I went to the west, a small avalanche (bigger than a sluff) knocked me off my feet, I rode for about 25' on top and came to a stop, got up and skied down and behind a tree about 50 yards above the cat track/road. The skier at the top skied a line through the trees and to the east of the small slide I kicked off and stopped to the east of the tree I was behind. The third skier side stepped down until what he thought was a lesser angle slope. He then skied across the small slide and went further to the west than I had skied down, this triggered the large avalanche, that pitched him forward, he rode the slide about 75 yards, past the tree I was behind before coming to a stop about 25 ft. below me. He was partially buried from waist down, but lying flat on this stomach with his face pointing down the hill but out of the snow. His waist down was buried a foot below the surface , which we had to dig him out. He noted that his knee was messed up, but he was able to ski with his weight all on the left ski out to the parking area.

Forecaster comments:
Hidden Canyon is an uncontrolled, backcountry area adjacent to the Brighton resort.  A very close call occurred there on Friday, December 20th--the day before this accident--and another skier triggered slide occurred there the day of this accident. Many people who use the ski area exit gates do not read the sign indicating the potential danger.  Hidden Canyon has been the site of many serious accidents and close calls in the past.  The victim sent us this report of the accident the day afterwards, so neither we, nor Brighton resort were aware of the accident the day it occurred.  In a subsequent email with the victim to clarify the details, he indicated that he was able to self-evacuate although he did have an injured knee.  He had a friend who helped retrieve his skis in the trees several hundred feet above him.  He said he saw other avalanches in that area.  It appears that he did not realize he was entering uncontrolled backcountry terrain.  

Luckily, there was a happy ending to this close call.  Thanks so much for posting.  This kind of information helps to save the lives of others.  We also strongly encourage people to trigger avalanches to report them to the nearest authorities to prevent rescuers from searching the areas unnecessarily.

When we changed our minds, we decided to cross the gulch at Chad's gap.  When we came to a steeper section on the way into the gulch, we decided to cross it one at a time.  While about 40ft ahead of my partner I was fooled into a false sense of security by my perceived brevity of a steep slope, and decided to continue.  Three steps into the slope the entire face broke about five feet above me.  It was a foolish decision not to turn back and continue up the cat track and around upon first sight of this slope.  Don't make the same mistake I did under the impression that it will save you time, and don't allow yourself to downplay the risks as I did: I was lucky cut to my left and stay on top of this slide.  

It is difficult to say whether the slide breaking to the facets was because of a step down from sloughing or caused entirely by my full weight being added to the snowpack.

This slope and adjacent slopes had been skied 15-20 times the day before. Yesterday, the exact slope had 6 sets of tracks from people skiing it the previous 3 hours. There were 8-10 sets of tracks on adjacent slopes. At around noon the breeze picked up and clouds rolled over, creating a slight greenhouse effect. Our party of 5 saw our first obvious large-spread collapsing and cracking around 1:30. We had upper Main MacDonald's Draw spider-web about the same time as Dutch's released. Don't know whether Dutch's Draw was directly skier released. Went to the foot of the slide and did a transceiver search but got nothing.

On the way from East Pass to Davenport Hill, one natural, soft slab avalanche was noted in a steep, north facing gully just skiers left of east pass, which appeared to have run this morning; the 30' wide, ~6"" deep crown, and the debris in the runout, was all covered by a few inches of new snow.  Additionally, I triggered an 8"" deep, 50' wide new snow, soft slab avalanche, from a safe spot on the ridge, in the next gully to the west, near the top of Davenport Hill.  Both of these slides appeared to have failed beneath the new snow on yesterday's faceted snow surface.

After cresting the top of Davenport hill, the next portion of ridgeline to the west was nearly snow free on the south side of the ridge, and I judged the north side of the ridge to be ""not steep enough to be a problem.""  My partner and I stopped for a moment, and I stated my feelings about the slope, and then walked onto it.  Staying very close to the ridge, I immediately felt the sandbox effect of a weak snowpack beneath this morning's snow, and after taking a couple steps, the avalanche broke at my feet.  The slab moved very slowly at first, and I was able to arrest on the bed surface, although the bed surface was so loose that I felt like I was treading water, well after the slab was off to the races below me. 

Overall, the slab was an average of 10""-12"" deep, with a couple portions stepping down into the late november facets, and one portion, on the eastern extremety of the slide, releasing near the ground, with the characteristic brown snow visible at the bottom of a ~three foot deep crown.  When I stood up, I measured the slope angle where I stood to be 32 degrees, although other portions of the bed surface measured exactly 36 degrees.  In places, this slab pulled out near the ridge on portions of ~30 degree terrain.  The debris ran through dense trees below me, and well onto the flats beneath the Silver Fork Headwall.  I called my friends in West Bowl who confirmed there was no one else in the area, and then called Alta Central.  

This was a close call--if I had entered the slope further to the east, where it is steeper, I would have been on a deeper portion of the slab and would likely have been strained through dense trees before riding a large debris pile to the flats.  It was similar to what has been, to my knowledge, my only other truly close call, in which I assumed my visual impression of a slope's steepness was correct, without having actually measured it previously, or personally seeing avalanches on the slope.  In both cases, i had made a deliberate assesment of terrain and snow conditions, and judged that I was about to do the right thing.  In both cases, I was in terrain I don't ski that much--not really a silver fork guy--but which I assumed could be navigated safely.  At this point, I lack a good, constructive summary, or words of wisdom...","Marginal photo of the trees beneath the starting zone, and mangled, rotten bed surface; fog and light snowfall made a photo of the runout difficult...","","Looking east, toward the deepest portion of the crown and steepest portion of the slope.

We were walking up Silver Fork yesterday afternoon (Sunday) and came across this small avalanche. It was difficult to tell when it had happened, but it looked fairly crisp and recent. Of significance was the slabs' characteristics as a hard slab, it's location above yet another major terrain trap, and it being on a common route out of silver fork. I dug a quick pit (the one in this other guy's photo) and found the weak layer to be the Thanksgiving Facets. Got an ECTX but a PST that resulted in likely propagation. Also of note my pit was not in the 'hard slab' as I was not into traveling that far into the slope. The slope was Northwest and 35degrees.

Here is an interview of the photographer by Black Diamond:

 ","","","FROM ANOTHER PERSONS PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS ON THE SCENE: 

Just wanted to clarify the events from the burial today as I was on the scene and am getting a lot of questions as to what was going on and the logistics of the parties.

There were 3 parties involved:

Party 1 - Skiing into the Gulch
Skier 1
Skier 2

Photographer
Party 2 - Skinning across the flats, 50m above the houses
Myself (RM)
KL

Party 3 - Skinning up the Michigan City road
AR
JC

Photographer skied down to mid slope for a good angle on the shot.  Skier 1 skied down right past Party 2 to gain momentum before dropping into the slope.  Slope fractures, Skier 1 pulls airbag, is swept into the gulch and fully buried.  Party 3 calls across to Party 2, and AR and RM descend into the gulch, to assist photographer.  JC and KL both call Alta Central, Skier 2 descends to KL wondering what is going on.  Probe strikes airbag at .5m depth.  Full recovery, no injuries.  Left ski was still on, right ski was lost in the pile.


In retrospect, my biggest takeaway is the importance of communication.  In this event, there were 3 people involved in the rescue, from 3 different parties.  None of us had ever met, and we all arrived at different times.  It was imperative that we communicate and work together so that we didn't get in each other's way, or duplicate the steps.  Everything said, I think we all are feeling lucky today that everything went so smooth.


FORECASTER COMMENTS: -Brett Kobernik

I spoke with the female that was caught and buried in the avalanche.  She described the day to me and it is a common scenario that other people have had happen to them before. It’s a scenario that could easily happen to many of us in the future.

 

The group of three (herself, another female and a male photographer) were shooting photos within the Alta Ski Area during the day.  It was one of those days with beautiful snow, great weather and everything was just coming together for them.  The invigorating conditions and bliss of the day is what clouded their judgement, in her opinion.  Again, this is a common theme that can happen to anyone.

 

They were not intending to go into the backcountry on this day, hence why some of the party did not have all of their normal avalanche gear.  However, as the day went on, it was decided that they would make the very short journey to a popular slope for photographing skiers and snowboarders.  They had read the avalanche advisory for that day and understood it.  Human triggered avalanches were likely on such slopes.  The awesome day that was in progress, the familiarity with the slope, as well as the perception of the slope being so small and not dangerous overrode their knowledge of the avalanche conditions.  

 

It was decided that the victim would go first since she was carrying all of her normal avalanche gear.  Once she was on the slope and realized she had triggered the avalanche, she immediately deployed her avalanche airbag and started the ride downhill.  She was on the surface and was purposely swimming for a group of trees which she managed to get to and grab a hold of, stopping herself briefly.  The second portion of the avalanche that released sympathetically overcame her and she was not able to hold on.  She was carried to the bottom and the rescue played out as described by the people who were there.

 

A note on airbags:  While it has been shown that airbags are not all that effective in terrain traps like this one, I speculate that it was helpful in preventing a deeper burial.  My guess is that it made it easier for her to swim toward the trees, which in turn slowed her progress to the bottom, and allowed more snow to move passed her before she came to a rest.  More than likely, during the second part of the ride, she remain closer to the surface which also helped prevent a deeper burial.  Just my two cents.


This scenario is a common theme and can happen to even the most experienced backcountry travelers.  The lure of the deep Utah powder is strong and it can influence even the most experienced and cautious people.  The victim was very candid when I spoke with her and I want to thank her for sharing her experience.  It was a perfect outcome to a bad situation that we can all learn from.

With the coast clear, we cut the cornice about 5 ft. wide and 1 ft. thick. This rectangular chuck dropped about 50 ft and then released about a 50 ft. wide section 8""-12"" deep. After passing the cliff in the picture it propagated skiers right and another 100 or so feet. The slide maximized about 100 feet after the second portion ripped. It traveled another 200 or so feet down.

I dodged a big bullet (as you can see by my ski tracks) and got extremely lucky....I did notice an even bigger slide in the same area someone kicked off with a cornice break.    I have never been in such a scary place and getting out was nothing short of a hellish-nightmare with ""collapsing"" layers everywhere, (the sound was nerve racking)  Fortunately, I did find a ""safety zone"" on  South facing ridge lines that provided a clean exit out of Days Fork, followed by sticking to the very top of the ridge line all the way back over to Flagstaff Peak.

FORECASTER COMMENTS:  While the actual trigger is unknown, Miss Kendall has good speculation on the trigger being a skier.  Furthermore, the fact that you can see ""creep"" in the crown (2nd photo below where the crown appears to be drooping downhill) indicates that the crown has sat around for a day or so.  Lack of fresh snow on top of the bed surface indicates it occurred AFTER it stopped snowing AND the wind stopped transporting snow.  This would put the most likely timing sometime on Sunday.  Maybe someone will confirm the speculation.  -Kobernik

""Some additional info on Collins Gulch... Partner & I went up Baldy Shoulder to observe snow pack with very little hope of skiing it. The higher we got, the less & less the snow behaved. Stayed on low angle terrain and were experiencing collapsing and lots of far running cracks. Retreated back down our up track and on the way down, noticed two slides that were not there on the way up. Thinking we possibly triggered them remotely seeing the cracking & plenty of energy in the snow pack. All it needed was enough of an angle to move. Plenty of dirty snow & facets for the new snow to move on.""

 ","","Forecaster Note:

While the weak layer of these slides cannot be determined with 100% accuracy by viewing them from a distance, a faceted weak layer is a distinct possibility.  Below is a photo from Sunday's Observation which shows that the starting zones of these avalanches had snow cover prior to the storm.  Being that almost all of the snow on the northerly aspects that I've looked at is faceted, it is quite likely that these failed on a faceted weak layer.  This is very pertinent information given our current situation and we will work on confirming this.

Slide initiated in the steep cliffs on the rider's left side within approximately  200 feet of the summit. As this Wet Loose Snow descended through the mid-slope steep cliff band it appeared to step down and gouge out a Wet Slab. The slide appeared to have occurred on Sunday, yet not confirmed. OF NOTE: This appears to be an indicator path for similar Northerly facing terrain that has not gone through a full spring transition. At this point in time we have now experienced minimal to non-existent refreezes for four consecutive nights. Mondays overnight questionable lows combined with a thick consistent cloud deck may provide the impetus to help develop significant  activity on Tuesday. With the overnight lows forecasted to dip on Tuesday evening the 30th, it appears that during the day on Tuesday the 30th we may be at a critical last day of this potential type of avalanche issue. 
Additional comment: As of the morning of the 30th, it appears that there has been more activity within the last 12 hours. Observations at 0800 hours on the morning of the 30th indicate that similar Wet Loose activity has now run on the rider's right side of the slide path. Debris piles from each incident appear to have accumulated to at least 1.5 meters deep. Wet activity appears immanent during the day on the 30th on upper elevation North facing terrain.

This occurred during a period of high PI and wind loading with mostly Light Category winds. The Soft Slab was predominantly 4 finger in hardness. Debris piles from the Main Rocky Points Chute was the deepest at approximately one meter deep. The initial weak layer was one to two inches above the old snow/new snow interface, and then it appeared to step down to the old snow/melt freeze crust. The weak layer was a light density layer in the new snow, directly above the interface. There was some bonding to the old snow, and this appeared to be a result of the warmth in the old snow surface. Interestingly, there were facets on top of the old snow surface on the highest starting zones in the NNE facing Rocky Points Main chutes. These facets were up to 1mm and were showing signs of rounding. Also, the old snow surface crust in this area was 1 to 2 inches deep and there were moderate sized facets below this crust; and this weakness was just one of three layers that were cracking.  Widespread cracking and collapsing was occurring on all slopes with angles > 30 degrees. Slopes between 30 and 35 degrees were cracking and not moving. All slopes with angles > 35 degrees were either already cleaned out or cracking, and very sensitive and easy to initiate activity. The cracking layers were 4 to 8 inches down, as well as at the old snow surface. Propagation was pronounced and rapid. 
Another avalanche of note was the Wet Slab observed in the lower half of the Main Dog Lake Chute. See photo. This appeared to be human triggered and produced when the snow surface was very wet/damp. The debris pile here was > one meter deep. It appeared that the trigger escaped off the slab to rider's right. This slide was 55 feet wide, 4 to 6 inches deep, and ran only 100 feet to the flats.

Quite a large group of people went in together to investigate the avalanche.  There was 5 Utah Department of Transportation forecasters including Chris Covington, Matt McKee, Bill Nalli, Adam Nesbitt and Steven Clark.  From the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center there was Drew Hardesty, Trent Meisenheimer and myself (Bruce Tremper) totaling eight people.
The victim was Craig Patterson, a forecaster for the Utah Department of Transportation Snow and Avalanche Program, which forecasts and controls avalanches for both Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon.  Craig was doing fieldwork alone on Kessler Peak to check out the snow stability conditions, because avalanche slopes on Kessler Peak can threaten the highway below.
Craig followed a fairly standard up-track used by both public backcountry skiers and by UDOT forecasters, which utilizes a thickly-treed ridge between avalanche paths locally known as God's Lawnmower, which is just west of the ridge and Kessler Slabs, which is just to the east of the ridge. He ascended the ridge using climbing skins and made switchbacks up the northeast-facing ridge.  As he neared the top of the ridge where he presumably planned to descend back down the ridge he ascended, his ascension track led around a corner from the northeast-facing ridge onto a steep, east-facing slope where he presumably triggered the avalanche that killed him.  The flank fracture of the slab was directly on the sharp ridge that divided the safer snow on the northeast facing slope from what appeared to be recently wind loaded snow on the east facing slope.  The distance of only a foot or two separated safe snow from dangerous snow.  It's uncertain whether he was planning to make another switchback to stay on the safer north facing side and just stepped around the corner too far or whether he planned to continue onto the east facing slope to examine the snow there.
The avalanche was a relatively small wind slab, about 6-8 inches deep (a foot deep in the deepest section) and about 45 feet wide.  It was on a very steep slope, which was 50 degrees at the crown face and 45 degrees where his track led across the flank wall of the slab fracture.  It's likely that the avalanche broke 40' above him as he stepped onto to the recently wind-loaded slope.  The avalanche path descends through many sparse trees and over a couple cliffs.  The avalanche swept him 1380' vertical feet down the slope where he came to rest on the surface of the debris with his avalanche airbag deployed.
He checked in by phone around 1:00 or 1:30 in the afternoon when he was high on the mountain and reported stable snow conditions. He failed to check in later in the day nor return home that evening so the authorities were notified.  His UDOT truck was still parked at the Cardiff Fork trailhead. A Life Flight helicopter was able to fly just before dark to search for him and they noticed the avalanche with a person on top of the debris and not moving, but the terrain was too steep to land.  Ground-based rescuers from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue under the command of Salt Lake County Sheriff accessed the area on foot after dark.  They found Craig's body on the surface of the debris with his avalanche airbag deployed and obvious trauma to his head and hip with rips in his pants.  He was obviously still in ""uphill mode"" as he will had a climbing skin on his ski (the other ski was missing) and he was dressed lightly.  He was laying head downhill and on his side.   His body was only about 50' vertical feet above the toe of the debris.
 

View of the accident site from the Big Cottonwood Canyon road.  The victim followed a standard climbing track up the northeast facing, densely-treed ridge and on his top diagonal, he crossed around a corner onto an east facing slope and triggered an avalanche, which descended down a different drainage than the one he ascended.
This is the site where the victim was found on the snow surface with his avalanche airbag deployed.  He was located where the person in the shadows is standing, which is about 50 vertical feet above the toe of the avalanche debris.
The victim's tracks are presumably the ones in the bottom of the photo and they lead into the flank wall of the avalanche he probably triggered.  It's unknown whether he was doing another switchback and strayed too far onto the steeper, more east-facing slope or whether he intended to examine the snow there.  The avalanche was a wind slab that was only about 8 inches deep and 45 feet wide but it was enough to catch him and sweep him down the steep slope.
Looking down the slope, which is quite steep--45 degrees where he stepped onto the slope and 50 degrees at the crown face.  It drains through many sparse trees and over a couple cliffs on the way down.
Looking downhill, you can see his ascent track on the left of the photo coming up towards the camera.  He ascended the gentler, northeast facing slope and then crossed over a divide in the center of the photo onto a steeper, east facing slope on the right of the photo (where the avalanche occurred)  that had different snow characteristics due to the different aspect with respect to wind and sun.","The slope where the avalanche occurred was very steep--50 degrees at the crown face and 45 degrees where his track led onto the slope.  The slope continues at around 45 degrees and strains through many sparse trees and at least two ~ 10' cliffs.   With so many obstacles, it would have been unlikely to survive an avalanche on that slope.  The slope is east facing with the crown face at 9921' and the bottom edge of the debris at 8540'.  The starting zone is slightly bowl-shaped, about 50' wide and it obviously collects wind drifted snow both from north and south winds.  ","I will fill in the details here later, but basically there were two snowstorms accompanied by wind in the 5 days previous to the accident that deposited new snow on top of a pre-existing sun crust.  Most of the snow had stabilized but there were lingering pockets of wind slabs and rapid warming on sun exposed slopes exacerbated the instability.  Thursday - April 11's quick storm deposited 4-8"" in the morning with gusty northwest winds along the high ridgelines.  Intermittent midday sun and increasing temperatures (rising to 30 degrees at a representative weather station at 9880' in Big Cottonwood Canyon) may have accentuated the sensitivity of the wind slab.  ","After seeing the accident site and the avalanche conditions, we all agreed that it was the kind of accident that could have happened to any of us.  In the mountains, sometimes the snowpack can vary dramatically with subtle variations in terrain and only a step too far can have huge consequences.  It was a sad day for all of us to lose a friend, a co-worker and such a wonderful person.
The accident was especially tragic because the victim, Craig Patterson, was not only a skilled forecaster but he was widely loved and admired.  He was, smart, a great public speaker and teacher and one of the finest human beings most of us had met.  Most tragic of all, he left behind a wife and a 6-year-old daughter.  
Special thanks to Wasatch Backcountry Rescue and Salt Lake County Search and Rescue for their hard, and sometimes dangerous work.  We are all very lucky to have such a great rescue team.
Final note: since he appeared to die from trauma and he was on the snow surface, having a partner with him probably would not have changed the outcome of this accident.  As one of the rescuers noted, ""It was a small avalanche but a really bad ride.""

As a matter of fact, record cold temperatures not only helped accelerate the faceting process, they also preserved early season weak snow. Light density snow storms did little to add weight or compression and the shallow pack sustained a strong temperature gradient through much of the winter.  Adding insult to injury, a series of post frontal East and Northeast wind events, hampered the upper elevation terrain from developing a deep snowpack. In essence, the Uinta's never turned the corner with snow stability this season and now they're getting the first real load of the season.
March can often be a good snow month for the Uinta's and this year winter returned from its hiatus early in the month, only to be interuptted by record warm temperatures on March 14th and 15th. While a wet slab cycle ensued on a handful of steep, rocky slopes, the range hardly came unglued. Basically there was no slab. The third week of March however signaled a return of winter as a series of storms piled up 2 feet of snow with little wind. Intermittent warm temperatures allowed the storm to to settle, but as it did a four finger slab formed. Where the pack was thin and shallow we saw an interesting snowmobile triggered slide break into old snow on the 25th. Detailed info can be found here-

The backside and top were blown with cornices and wind crust that was significant about 4” to 6”, and showing signs of  fracturing along the up track. At the summit, it was blown off snow crust and wind damaged. The top had definite temps that were cold and winter-like. After skiing down the first 150 ft. or so of vertical it seemed like the crust softened up. Prolly a lack of judgment to decided to go further down the rabbit hole. Another 500 ft. and the first avalanche  broke on a ski cute, from the second skier down, and could easily have taken this skier down about 500 ft., with the run out.  Had he gone down, definitely would have ruined the day. Subsequent other slabs were breaking all the way down (another 3 to 4 broke) as we possibly entered into areas where the wind and chill factor did not mitigate the temperatures to stop the effects of wet slab breaking on the fracture line of the new snow. That is the most I have seen Patsy breaking in some significant times skiing the mountain. Prolly would not recommend anyone go up there for more of the same, until it settles out more. It was crust but was ski-able and some fun turning.","","",""

	We were observers of this avalanche not the involved party. The skier caught said he was going to write up a report. We went back and inspected the crown and had some good pictures so I figure we would submit a report as well.  

	 

	We skinned up to the top of Red Top from the White Pine parking lot. A man and a women were behind us as we ascended Red Top. On the ascent it was around 30 degrees F but the wind was blowing 25-30mph gusting to 40mph. As we skinned we mentioned to each other multiple times that it seemed odd that there was not a section on wind slabs in the morning avalanche report. We skinned to the far skiers right chute and the group behind us stopped above the middle chute. The first skier in on our run popped out a small wind slab but it didn't run and was easily avoided. 
	 

	Forecaster note: Sometimes we hate forecasting in spring because the weather is so changeable.  The winds were not ""supposed"" to blow very hard.  Spring!  If it isn't one thing it's another.

	 

	When we got to the bottom we saw that the group behind us had triggered a large avalanche. We skied over to make sure they were both okay. The man said he had triggered the avalanche at the top and ended above the snow almost at the toe of the debris. He was very shaken up. He was super lucky and definitely knew it. He was able to find both skis but lost a pole and his goggles and hat. He was able to ski back down, but said that his right ankle hurt a bit. The woman had skied down after him and was unharmed but also a bit shaken up. 

	 

	We skinned back up to the top for a second run and to take a look at the crown. It looked like the man had skied first and as he traversed into the run he was on top of a hard slab that broke almost 50ft above him. The crown was only 25 ft wide but almost 2ft deep initially then broke a shallow wind slab down the whole west facing ridgeline around 150ft wide and maybe 5 inches deep (however it was hard to tell how deep the slab was because by the time we got back to the top it had almost filled back in). The avalanche ran over rocks and through a choke pulling the old soft snow with it. As the avalanche hit the apron it fanned out. The debris pile was only between 2 and 3 feet deep, however there were still chunks of snow 3ft by 3ft by 2ft.

	 

	Very glad that everybody was okay, and definitely a learning experience for me. ","","","","SIde view of the debris pile","View of crown and path from the bottom (first) and from the top of Scotty's bowl (second)","Picture of the hardslab crown and the point of entry for the skier trigger"

In Maybird, Hogum, and Coalpit Gulch, storm totals since wednesday seem to mirror ski resort study plot data from the upper cottonwoods, with up to a couple feet of light density snow sitting atop the nuclear MF crust from last weekend.  Winds were calm from the NW all day, with sun shining through the low cloud deck occaisionally, but not enough to cause significant wet activity, at least in the higher elevations.  SE-S-W will likely have a slight crust tomorrow.  

Only two significant avalanches were obvious today, in places where you'd expect to see some activity during a windy snowstorm.  Most interesting was a long running, soft-slab avalanche originating in the alluvial feature beneath, and lookers right, of the choke of the upper chute in the Hypodermic Needle--just below where skiers commonly traverse out of the needle and onto the ridgeline between the Coalpit Headwall and the Needle.  This avalanche failed on light density snow from wednesday, 3/20, which sits atop a pencil hard, brown MF crust, and just beneath a 2 inch deep, 1F slab of graupel from thursday morning, 3/21.  Much of the crown was blown in, but a small portion was still exposed, and my best guess is that this slide ran during or just after the period of high precipitation intensity on 3/21.  Debris ran to within a few hundred feet of the creek in Hogum fork, and was covered by new snow from the last few days, and I'd call it a D2.5--your Hummer would have been totaled, but it would still resemble a Hummer.  Debris was still soft underneath ~10"" of new snow, which corroborates my impression that the slide occurred early in this storm cycle.  Another large slide occured in the eastern-most slide path on the coalpit headwall, with impressive deposition apparent ~1500' below the ridgeline.  

No other obvious slides in outer-LCC today, although it is a hoot to see the wet-slide carnage from last weekend just barely obscured by our new snow.

Since thursday, 3/21, I've found the MF crust/stellars/graupel slab combination to continue to be sensitive, with quick snowpits, ski cuts, and cornice drops showing failure propagation in this layering is still possible.  This is certainly a manageable problem, but I'm guessing this weakness will remain active for a few days on isolated terrain features where light density snow from 3/20 sits on top of a MF crust.","","",""

My best guess is Sunday when the sun came out.  The debris had no new snow on it.  The debris pile was quite large and the storm slab had pulled out all the old snow most of the way down.  The debris was very close to the summer trail at the bottom and if caught would certainly have buried and possibly killed someone as they got drug over the ground surface.  This was an eye opener and was an obvious indicator to stay off steep south facing wind effected slopes.
I dug a pit higher up the drainage below Manns at about 11,800 just below the tree line facing south.  New snow depth was about 10 inches.  HS 160 CTN, moderate shovel sheer pulled out about 2 feet of snow on a very thin weak layer ( 1 cm thick ) of buried near surface facets.
The snow has filled in very nicely in the La Sals (180 cm in sheltered terrain) however much of the alpine has been scoured clean, the tree line and lower is deep and quality is very high.  I expect the sun to have it's way with the snow today and begin our first corn cycle.  I expect the steep south slopes to off limits mid-day as the sun bakes the snow into wet mush.

They were skiing above some cliffs and one boarder knocked off a fairly deep slide maybe 2-3 ft deep max and only 30 or so feet wide. It broke on a convex rollover and didn't take the boarder for a ride. The rider would have been taken over some cliff bands about 30-50 feet of rock and trees. The slide ran about 500 feet or so fanning out onto the apron below. If the snowboarder had been taken for a ride, it could have been ugly. Glad the boarder was okay we didn't have to help with a possible rescue. After watching the party trigger the slide, the visibility disappeared. We later saw out tracks from their descent through the cliff bands. They were very lucky. Sorry no pics, forgot the camera and there was little visibility in my travels there today.
Forecaster Comments:  While the avalanche may have been a new wind slab, my speculation is that it failed on older faceted snow.  Depth and location (thinner rocky terrain) leads me to believe this.  What's more, the piece of snow sits 'unsupported' by the cliff bands below and offer two red flags for terrain/snow assessment.  

	
		One - there is no compressive support from below - the avalanche only needs to overcome friction at the weak layer interface as well as tensile strength around the upper/side perimeter of the slide.  
	
		Two - the obvious consequences of getting dragged over the cliff.

Deepest part of the crown was 10 inches, ended up running quite a ways because of the slick crusted bed surface. Kowboy was the first skier in, he cut the slope with no results and proceeded to ski to the bottom. Makoff was second in, he teased the cat a little more into the wind slab and it released about 20ft above him, he dug into the bed surface and it washed around him. Not life threatening, ran fairly slow and did not entrain a ton of snow but worth mentioning. Only wind slabs we were finding that were suspect were right at the top of the highest ridges, and easily managed with ski cuts. Pics: crown, full slide, Brad pondering his mess.
FORECASTER COMMENTS (kowboy): The wind slabs were very easy to recognize prior to getting onto them.  If you were aware they were present, they did not pose much threat and were very manageable for those with good avalanche experience.  This was the case at the top of Cardiac Ridge.  I was actually surprised that I was not able to get this pocket to release with the couple of ski cuts I did.  Brad tickled it just slightly deeper than I and it released.

Conditions on the skin track were fine in the shade, but upon hitting anything in the sun the snow was wet and very sticky.  We did notice a light melt freeze crust in the trees below about 8000 feet presumably from greenhousing.  The mid elevation snow on the north side of the compass seemed great.  After gaining the ridge and seeing pretty significant cornices we decided to cut one to check stability. We were the only party on the skin track up to that point and felt comfortable that no one would be approaching in the area below.  Unable to get anything sizeable to drop from the first cornice without exposing ourselves, we moved on to another more overhanging cornice up the ridge.  Of note with the first cornice, we did remark that the snow surface the smaller chunks landed on did not seem too deep, perhaps a wind slab with some new snow on top.  

The second cornice provided a definative result.  Upon dislodging a chunk in the 300-400 lb. range the slope below avalanched.  The avalanche was interesting in a couple ways.  It was obviously a slope that had been wind loaded, and the intitial fracture looked to be a thick wind slab 1-2.5 feet.  As the slide ran, it looked to dig into the older snow (facets) exposing logs and rocks.  My best guess is that this slope has slid earlier this season leaving a thinner snowpack and well developed facets that the new snow was on top of, but due to hangfire I was not comfortable getting onto the bed surface.  I was able to get close to the toe of the slide, but have already seen what the slope was capable of, it didn't feel the need to explore too much.  The debrie pile was spread out over a 28-29 degree slope about 1-3 ft deep.  Overall the slide was small and probably would not fully bury a person, but the energy and terrain could most certaintly cause severe trauma.  

This was a slope that we were comfortable skiing today before the slide and had in fact sought out due to its elevation and aspect.  I feel that there is a decent chance that if we just dropped the slope we would not have gotten it to slide under the weight of a person.  For myself and my partners today, this is a great learing experience.  By the forecast alone this slope would have fallen into the low category today.  Upon looking at the more sublte signs before going for the center punch we were able to discover a more complex situtation.  The January facets have not gone anywhere, the slope we were looking at had signs of wind loading (obvious from the cornice above, but not on the slope proper).  Ultimately this is a tough situtatation to call.       ","","",""

The following accident summary was related to us through the Sevier County Sheriff.

A group of snowmobilers left 12 mile Canyon for a day of snowmobiling.  Just east of the head of 12 mile Canyon the group was playing in a broad flat bottom valley with small steep slopes on the west side.  The group was separated some what as everyone was having fun on different terrain features. At about 4 o'clock or a bit later the group noticed that one member was missing. They backtracked a bit to find a fresh avalanche and figured he must be buried in it. There was no sign of him or his snowmobile and he was not wearing an avalanche beacon. The group was not able to locate him and were forced to call search and rescue.  The search and rescue team arrived and was able to finally locate part of the buried snowmobile. The victim ended up being buried beneath the snowmobile and the rescue team extricated him but it was too late.  The victim was a 30 year old male buried at least 4 feet deep.","The slope was an average of 38 degrees in steepness but rolled over to 40 degrees at the bottom.  It had an abrupt transition in the runnout zone.  It started at 10,400' and faced northeast.","The snowpack in the southern part of the Manti Skyline has remained shallower than average for most of the winter especially early on in December and January.  It is about half the depth of areas above Fairview and Mt Pleasant.  A shallow snowpack is very susceptible to having weak sugary snow form especially in the cold months of December and January. This is exactly what happened this season and these weak layers that formed got buried by snow storms. A few snowmobile triggered avalanches in this region occurred in early February (Slide 1  Slide 2)  revealing the potential that these weak layers had. Snow storms in February along with some recent westerly winds created a slab on top of these weak layers. This region has a very shallow snowpack of only up to about 2 feet deep. A telltale sign of a slab over week sugary snow is when you notice your snowmobile track sinking through the upper layer and sandboxing in the sugary snow.
 ","FORECASTER COMMENTS:

It is not uncommon for groups of snowmobilers to get scattered about in play areas but, obviously, this poses a serious risk when someone climbs a steep slope without a partner watching them. The only sure way of staying out of an avalanche is to stay off and out from under all slopes that are 30° in steepness or steeper.  However, many of us, including myself, choose to recreate in avalanche terrain.

One of the methods that I use to reduce my risk is to closely follow the snowpack progression on certain steep slopes throughout the entire winter. This way I am aware of any weak layers that form. I then know if it is safe to get onto these steep slopes after every subsequent snowstorm.

It is a risky endeavor to draw conclusions about a slope with out actually getting on to it and digging into the snow.  This takes a high level of avalanche skill and years of assessing snowpack layering to be able to determine how much new snow and wind a certain slope can withstand before avalanching.

Keeping track of certain slopes may seem unreasonable if you only get out a few times a winter or travel to many different areas.  Also, you can literally get on to hundreds of avalanche slopes in one day on a snowmobile.  How is a person supposed to be able to keep track?  It is near impossible and without knowing the underlying structure of the snowpack, it's a 'crap shoot' getting onto steep avalanche terrain.

A good line of defense if you are going to risk getting into steep terrain is to learn to recognize buried weak sugarary snow and learn to recognize when a slab has formed on top of it.

The left flank of this part of the slide appeared to be the main failure point, and the total snow height at this failure point was no more than 70 cm deep. The location and width of this slide was almost identical to the previous slide here on 1/28/13. This slide was much shallower than the previous slide, though after looking at the snowpack structure the buried persistent weak layer from the initial (1/28/13) deep persistent hard slab avalanche is still lingering. OF NOTE: Upon investigation, this lower weak layer actually failed and left a gaping crack at the old buried crown face at 75 cm down from the surface. Also of note was the similar way this ""repeater"" propagated out towards the Back Bowls at a lower elevation right where the public traverse has been traveling. The lower propagation was another 65 feet wide; and this area continues to have a very thin weak cover. Where these two parts of the slide intersect appears to be where both the January 28th slide and the February 24th slide were triggered and or initiated. There continues to be a large mostly uncovered  boulder field directly below the main part of the slide; and there is a much safer traverse below this boulder field that leads into the Back Bowls. As noted by the above snowpack profile there are still two significant buried persistent weak layers remaining on this slope; and it appears that they may still become sensitive and reactive with any new significant loading in the future.

Looking on the fetch to the south, a significant row of trees may be a catalyst for this path, slowing the snow so it loaded on this steep rocky gullies ,  and while several other exposed ridgelines had been blown to the dirt from SW winds, that was not the case here.  This is the only activity we saw all day long, where we skiied is included in our ob. 
Obviously faceting in the rocks is the weak layer, the pictures tell it all.  Recent wind loading yesterday and overnight, failed on facets in rocky shallow area. 
FORECASTER COMMENTS:  Darce is on it here.  I've noted numerous areas where the wind has stripped the snow creating a shallow snowpack that is much weaker than the deeper areas.  This is tricky as these shallow areas become buried and there are no obvious signs that they are holding a shallow and weak snowpack under the newer snow.  The only way is to follow certain slopes throughout the winter so you know what the structure is and how it progresses.  Otherwise, it's a 'crap shoot'.  I am also a bit surprised to see natural activity but the winds no doubt picked up enough to transports snow on Sunday.

All four were on the lower 1/4 to 1/3 of the slope when a natural avalanche released above them around 1 to 1:30 pm.  The two upper people were about 20 or 30 feet apart, and the upper most person saw the wall of snow coming down and yelled.  Both were caught, carried and tumbled, and estimate the distance they were carried to be about 75 yards.  The upper person (A) was buried to his neck, with one hand out, the lower person (B) ended up on top, though his face was cut up.  The two lower people on the slope heard the yelling, saw a ""wall of white"", and scattered and were not caught.
Person B immediately began the search for person A.  He determined that the two below hadn't been caught, and started running uphill doing a beacon search and yelling.  When person A quickly yelled back, he was able to rapidly locate him and dig him out.  It was determined he had a lower leg injury, and couldn't stand.  With no cell phone coverage in that part of Broads, two people headed out for help while one stayed with person A.  They were only able to get a call for assistance out well below the foot bridge.
Rescuers tried to land a helicopter in the area in the afternoon, but visibility was too poor due to low clouds and light snow showers.  So Salt Lake County Search and Rescue and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue responded on skis.  Later that evening, around 9:30 pm there was better visibility, and the injured person was evacuated by helicopter.  The party rescued wish to heartily thank them for their hard, cheerful work on such a cold, late Sunday.
Photo below is the hole relatively near the toe of the slide where the person buried to their neck was dug out.          ","The area above where the party was traveling has widespread, steep, rock slabs on the slopes above and glide avalanches sometimes occur in this area. While the slide they were caught in was large and serious compared to the size of a person, the avalanche that released is only a very small portion of the avalanche potential in Broads Fork.  There are many other steep slopes adjacent to and above the slide that released.
This party appeared to just have some bad luck and they were  just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  With an up track in a slightly different spot, they would not have been hit by this particular slide on this particular day, but would have been vulnerable to other potential slides. 
The debris had many very large, icy blocks, particularly higher up in the track.  The upper debris also spread into and through the trees.  They were very lucky to have been low when the slide released, and were mostly involved in soft slab debris.","","Another overview photo of the slide, a photo taken at the toe of the slide looking up (slope angle from toe to crown was approximately 31 degrees).  The third photo shows how efficiently even a shallow gully channels the snow of the avalanche, creating deep debris. 
","","","Photos close to the crown, and looking up at the crown.
After looking at the slide, I have to assume it was a natural, glide avalanche.  The slide is complex - in addition to the glide part that released to the rock slab, parts released in the upper pack only to the sides and in the track,  and portions of the glide section rapidly ""stepped up"" even on the slab.  I don't feel the party was close enough to the starting zone to have released a shallow slide remotely, that then would have triggered the deeper slide.  There were no other weather events occurring at the time that would have released a natural, shallower slide first. 
Glide occurs when the entire snow pack moves as a unit on the ground or rock slabs below--similar to the way a glacier moves and they can release catastrophically at random intervals.  They often occur without warning without any obvious weather contributory factors.  The crown face looked like it had ""older areas""  - portions that had been exposed to the air for a much longer time."

A group of four skiers spent the day in Broad's Fork skiing several slopes including Bonkers and a couple runs on Great West.  On their last run, they skied off the NE side of Peak 9924, which is on the ridge between Broads Fork and Mill B South.  It is a 2,000 vertical foot run.  The upper half is a 35-degree slope through gladed trees and looks like a deceptively easy descent but the lower half rolls over into a series of cliffs the bottom of the Mill B South drainage.
Two skiers descended partway and waited in some trees.  The third skier started down while the fourth skier waited on the ridge.  The third skier got about 4 turns into the run when he triggered a large, hard-slab avalanche about 3-4 feet deep and quite wide.  He yelled ""Avalanche!"" to the others below and one was able to grab a tree and the other scrambled out of the way.  The third skier was going to deploy his avalanche airbag pack but he impacted a tree before he could pull the trigger.  The tree stopped him and the debris washed over him and buried him with his head sticking out.  He injured his knee in the impact with the tree.  The fourth skier on top came down with his beacon on receive and found the third skier and helped him get out.  Luckily no one took the full ride to the bottom because it would most likely be un-survivable because it descended through gladed trees and over several cliffs on its 2,000 vertical foot path.
The injured skier hobbled down, sliding on his rear much of the way.  He found one of his skis about halfway down.  It was difficult negotiating the various cliff bands.  At the bottom, he was able to ski out on one ski.  He was obviously very lucky.","","","shallow snow on ridge.

We also noted a crazy variety of conditions on the east/west running ridge line we traveled on. Everything from localized whomphing, to  fully supportable sun crusts that were still dry underneath, to unsupportable facet pits, changing with each step. Hand pits showed the same tremendous amount of variety in small areas on similar aspects all of which made us pretty uncomfortable with the idea of skiing pretty much anything even a little steep.

""Whisky Hill"" is a steep, popular hill climbing area on the eastern flanks of the Monte Cristo snowmobiling complex between Huntsville and Woodrruff Utah.  The paved summer road between Huntsville and Woodruff passes near Whisky Hill but the road is not plowed in winter, making it a popular snowmobiling area.  To get from the road to the bottom of Whisky Hill, most people have to descend one of two narrow, steep-sided ravines, one on the north side or one on the south side. 
A group of very experienced and well-avalanche-trained snowmobilers decided to descend the ravine on the south side of Whisky Hill.  They were the first group to descend this gully since the last storm.  They were spread out and the lead snowmobiler triggered a large, hard slab avalanche as he descended in the bottom of the ravine.  He triggered it from the bottom and it fractured out the entire slope above him, which broke out in a hard slab 4' deep and about 400 feet across.  The crown face (upper fracture) of the avalanche was about 250-300 vertical feet above the bottom of the ravine (and the victim).
The snowmobiler who triggered the avalanche noticed the slope buckle and he gunned his snowmobile in an attempt to escape but the avalanche caught and buried him in the ravine bottom about 4' deep and buried his snowmobile about 10' deep, just a few feet away from him.  Both he and the snowmobile were pushed up against trees. The avalanche partially caught the next rider but he was not buried.  The rest of the group quickly located the buried snowmobiler with beacons, then quickly struck him with a probe and several people quickly dug him out.  It was a textbook rescue, executed flawlessly.  They uncovered the victim in about 5 minutes.  Luckily, this group regularly practices rescue scenarios and the practice paid off.
As a final note, they indicated that there was another group of about 6 snowmobilers following them that planned to descend the same gully.  They did not appear to have any rescue gear.  So perhaps the group that triggered this avalanche prevented a very tragic accident.
 ","The ravine runs roughly east-west and both sides of the ravine are steep sided--around 35 degrees.  The slope that avalanched faced southeast, is 35 degrees at the top of the slab and 32 degrees on the lower half of the slope.  The slope is only about 300 vertical feet and the avalanche was about 250 vertical feet from the fracture line to the bottom of the ravine and about 300 vertical feet to where the debris stopped as it traveled down the ravine.  The slope is un-treed.  Above the slope, there is a large, flat fetch, which is near the top elevation of the surrounding terrain, so the wind obviously had deposited a wind slab onto the steep slope.  Strong northwest winds over the previous days transportd a lot of snow onto the downwind southeast facing slopes.","The avalanche was a very hard and thick slab formed from wind-deposited snow.  The weak layer was a layer of faceted snow that formed in the first half of January.  A period of heavy snowfall occurred during the last couple weeks of January capped off by strong winds from the northwest for the 2-3 days previous to the accident.
It's unusual for faceted snow to form on slopes that face the south half of the compass in Utah because at this latitude, the sun usually is warm enough to either prevent the formation of faceted snow or destroy it after it forms.  For whatever reason, we have noticed a number of other avalanches on southeast facing slopes with a similar snowpack structure.
My snow profiles along the crown face of the avalanche showed Extended Column Tests failing on easy elbow taps and Compress tests failed on easy elbow taps as well (ECTP-11) (CT-11 x3).  All failed on the faceted snow layer about 4 feet deep.
The avalanche advisory from the Utah Avalanche Center for the Ogden area mountains called for a Considerable Danger (orange, level 3) because of persistent slabs and recent wind drifting.","This is a 15' deep hole where they dug out his snowmobile.  The top of the snowmobile was about 10 feet deep.  The victim was buried about 4' deep.

My first thought was that no one would believe that I actually straight-lined anything and without any pictures, video, or documentation that still may be suspect.
My second thought was... I should've read my own forecast which mentioned this exact thing. Fortunately I reacted quickly once I realized I was pulling the dogs tail too hard. However, in hind sight I should've never been  teasing it in the first place. Spacial variability is a crazy thing and given the current snowpack structure I think it'll become more of a player in the next few days.

The slide was triggered by skier A on a mid-slope roll over, who skied off the slab.  Skier B, triggered a 12' wide section of hangfire (the cut was sorta intentional, the ride not....)  and went for a 35' ride, very minor, he sat on the slow moving slab.  Terrain did not allow him to ski off the slab.  Skier B looked at the trigger for his airbag pack and decided it was not needed.  Skier A watched skier B and thought ""don't bother with the airbag"".
 
It is doubtful that this would have occurred if the slope angle had been a few degrees less.  Both Skiers had observed similar snow pack structures in the last week or two.

One thing is very clear... this is truly a tragic avalanche accident-
A family is out for a day of snowmobiling and they take a break for lunch in a wide open basin on the West Fork of the Duchesne. Four young family members walk to the edge of what appears to be a packed trail, however the edge is a cornice. They collapse the slope and two boys ages 7 and 14 are caught, carried, and subsequently buried at the bottom of the slope.
While the father looks for the two boys, the mother jumps on her snowmobile and heads towards the trailhead to find help. She runs into State Parks grooming personnel who then activates 911. Wasatch and Summit County S&R along with two medical helicopters are dispatched.  The small avalanche path is difficult to locate, but when the medical helicopters land, they discover the father performing CPR on both of his sons.
The two boys are flown from the scene and pass away later in the evening at the hospital.
Many thanks to all the heroic efforts put forth by Wasatch and Summit County Search and Rescue along with State Parks and Air Med personnel.","Short and moderately steep, this isn't a big, radical slope. However, the wide open, flat basin provided the perfect environment for recent swirling winds to form a very cohesive slab.","The western Uinta snowpack is about as Continental as it gets for a range located in Utah. Cold temperatures, high elevation terrain, and shallow snow depths are the norm for the range. We often see deep instabilities linger late in the season. The early portion of the winter started with a promising storm track and relatively warm temperatures. While the region experienced a large natural and remotely triggered avalanche cycle the week of Dec. 17th, in general avalanche activity has remained unusually predictable and the snowpack has been relatively strong. Very cold temperatures filtered into the region on January 11th, lasting to the 15th. Overnight lows reaching to -25 degrees were common in low laying basins with terrain features similar to the West Fork of the Duchesne. During this time about a foot of very light density snow fell. Jan. 14-17 brought very strong Northeast winds to the region. Averaging 30-40 mph with gusts into the 60's and 70's, winds channeled through this basin, forming very dense slabs in unusual locations.","The Utah Avalanche Center updates the western Uinta advisory program Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday and during times of heightened avalanche danger or when a watch or warning is issued. The danger was rated as Moderate for Wednesday Jan 16th and changing weather was not a factor in this accident.
From the Jan. 16th advisory-
""Northerly winds have been brutal along the high ridges and they're having no problem whipping all the fresh new snow into stiff wind drifts. Today you'll find these chalky looking, hollow sounding slabs along the leeward side of mid and upper elevation ridges. They're most prevalent on slopes facing the south half of the compass, but I suspect you'll find a fresh drift or two cross-loaded in upper elevation chutes and gullies as well. In either case, todays slabs will break a bit wider and deeper than you might expect.""

Forecaster's Note: Noise does not trigger avalanches but it is possible for the rotor wash of the helicopter to trigger avalanches in rare cases.  Since many wet snow sluffs were coming down naturally all day long, it's also possible that this is a natural wet, point-release that came off the rocks at the same time. ","","",""

It is hard to say exactly when this slide ran, but it must have been between the 1/11 storm and the 1/16 wind event.  This terrain is seldom visited by humans due to the location and difficulty of access.  In the photos there is a clear crown face and the bed surface had been scoured by the strong N and NE winds earlier this week.  Notice the bald spot near the summit.  This spot seems to always be devoid of snow and is indicative of the wind that flows through that drainage.  Some large pieces of cornice/crown are visible in the second and third pictures, along with some severe wind damage to the bed surface.
My hypothesis is that the slope was loaded with snow and SW winds during the beginning of the last storm and then ran naturally.  The following wind event then scoured the bed surface to the ground.

Two skiers, Skier A (male 30 years old) and Skier B (female 43 years old) were going ski touring in Porter Fork of Mill Creek Canyon.  Skier A has around 7 years of backcountry experience and has taken an avalanche course and Skier B had gone into the backcountry sporadically for years and had been getting more enthusiastic about it over the last couple.  They regularly read the local avalanche advisory and were aware of what conditions were present and what to expect during the day.  They both were carrying all of the proper avalanche safety equipment.
They ascended Porter Fork and decided to go into West Porter Fork.  They were around half way up and were finding instability within the new snow by doing quick hand pits along the way.  Their intention was to gain the more low angled slope to the saddle.  They were sticking to a treed sub-ridge.  As they approached a decision making point, the lure of a better powder run clouded their judgement.  They devieated from their plan and started to ascend a steeper portion of the slope perhaps not intending to go very high.  They didn't make it too far when Skier A who was out in the lead felt a large collapse and saw the slope high above start to crack and open up.  They both new what was happening and turned their skis downhill for a quick moment before the massive avalanche overtook them.
Skier A reports being thrown head first downhill and going for a violent ride before miraculously getting snagged in some trees and having the avalanche mostly wash over him.  The avalanche stopped and Skier B was not visible.  Skier A freaked out for a moment and then took a second to compose himself.  This was a very good move as he was able to start thinking clearly and remembered his training with the rescue equipment.  He switched his avalanche beacon to ""receive"" mode and immediately picked up a signal.  He reported that he easily pinpointed his partner after a very short period of time and was able to dig her out from under one to two feet of snow.  She started to breath laboriously and then QUIT BREATHING!!  Skier A then completely extricated her from the hole and started rescue breathing on her.  After a number of breaths she started labored breathing again and slowly came back to conscience.  She had lost a glove and a ski boot not to mention her skis.  Skier A started getting all of their extra clothing on her and wrapped her foot with a down jacket and a plastic bag.  At this time, another lone skier who was descending the avalanche path stumbled across them and started to assist with rescue efforts.  Skier B was able to regain enough composure to start to descend the slope with assistance.  A call to 911 was made and a helicopter was dispatched which eventually located the party and evacuated them.  Skier B sustained frostbite on her hand and foot but it appears no other trauma was sustained.
The following was reported by Brandon Dodge who leads the snow safety at Brighton Ski Resort and is heavily involved with Wasatch Backcountry Rescue:
I am sure other details and reports will come together about this incident, but I wanted to give my two cents. This is a perfect example of the tremendous rescue community and resources we have available and working together in the Wasatch. Unified Police Dept received a report of an avalanche with a full burial, injuries and loss of equipment in Porter Fork of Millcreek Canyon. Salt Lake County search and Rescue was activated as was WBR (Wasatch Backcountry Rescue) at 540 pm. SAR team members responded to Porter Fork and began a ground assault towards the victims with snowmobiles and skiers. The Dept of Public Safety (Utah Highway Patrol) helicopter was called out to shuttle WBR members to the scene.  The DPS helicopter picked up two members of  WBR at Brighton Resort and shuttled them to the scene. The patient was assessed and both victims were loaded into the helicopter and flown to waiting EMS crews in Millcreek canyon (Unified Fire). The DPS helicopter returned to pick up WBR members and return them to Brighton. The WBR members were back on the ground and the SAR teams returned to Incident Command by 850 pm. My hat is off to the incredible rescue system, forward thinking incident commanders and volunteer rescuers we have in the Wasatch. This rescue involved 6 agencies and was handled with perfection. VECC (Valley Emergency Call Center) received the call and promptly notified Unified Police Dept and Unified Fire Authority. Salt Lake County SAR, The Dept of Public Safety and WBR all were called out to assist. It going pretty much goes without saying that victims of such a traumatic incident, injured, deep in the backcountry and without the gear and assistance to self-rescue would most likely not survive the -10 or lower temps of Saturday night. 
A lone skier (happened to be a friend or ours at the UAC) stumbled onto the avalanche as he was walking the ridgeline and sent us this account as well as some photos:
Started the day in Thaynes w two runs. Tough deep trail breaking. Noted collapsing on ascent. Decided to finish the day by summiting Porter Peak, via the ridge route separating West Porter and Thaynes. Noted collapsing on ascent. On approach to Porter Peak observed east facing bowl beneath Porter Peak had avalanched. Decided bed surface would be safe descent. Took several photos. Sun was low, about 4:30 pm, decided to exit West Porter. Came across person A. A informed he and his partner person B had trigger the avalanche while ascending bowl. A had lost a pole. B had lost both poles, both skis, and a boot. A and I fashioned a boot for B with a down jacket and skin bag, secured w two voile straps. B had a cell phone so I told A to call 911. At this time it is 5pm. The three of us begin to descend, A and I assisting B. An hour passes, it is dark and a helicopter flys by us, just like in the movies, it doesn't see us. We agree I will leave A and B to notify search and rescue where A and B are. I descend West Porter to the Porter Fork road and meet search and rescue. After talking w them for a few minutes the helicopter locates A and B and they are safely extracted, according to the last information I had.
Note:  Although this may not make sense to people with little avalanche experience, It is often a safe and common practice to descend an avalanche path that has recently avalanched which is what our friend was doing, using the avalanche path as a safe exit from Porter Fork.","This avalanche path is an east northeast facing path with a starting zone at about 9400' and is around 40 degrees in steepness.  The avalanche was measured at 700 feet wide and ran just over 800 feet vertical distance and had a crown face that averaged 2 feet deep.  The starting zone is 40 degrees.  The avalanche was triggered from lower on the slope where the slope angle is less.  Photo thanks to Michael Junulaitis.
","Two weeks of cold dry weather prior to the accident contributed to the surface of the snow becoming very weak through the ""near surface faceting"" process where the surface snow basically turns into a weak and ""sugary"" snow grains.  A rime crust capped off these facets.  A somewhat unusual snow storm produced large amounts of snow in areas that don't usually see all that much coupled with moderate wind speeds with stronger gusts which helped form the ""slab"" on top of the rime crust and weak snow beneath.  There was not quite enough snow to produce a natural avalanche cycle but the conditions were pushed to the point where all that was needed was some humans to prod at it a bit to produce avalanches.
Below is a picture of the faceted weak layer which was between ""fist"" and a ""four finger"" hand hardness.  The slab itself was a ""four finger"" plus layer of snow with low density snow on the surface.

As I was skiing and took 3 or 4 turns on the slab the slope ripped underneath me and the snow continued down the gully.  The weak layer was at the ground, old faceted snow, with wind deposited and storm now on top.

The second photo shows the whole slide path.  The gully had facets and a wind slab on it while the slopes on either side did not.
","This final photo shows a photo I took up in Alexander Basin in Mill Creek during the inversion.  Notice that the tip of Antelope Island is exposed while the rest is socked in. This potentially explains why the steep larger slopes we skied at higher elevations were more stable than the lower elevation slopes that slid (on a relative scale of course, it was all ""low elevation terrain""). Perhaps facets grew more in the clouded and cooler lower elevations and not at the higher ones that were able to get some sun.  I put this out there to emphasis the odd conditions mentioned in yesterday's forecast.  With this wacky storm and lots of snow at lower elevations, the conditions are not the same everywhere and people may be motivated to ski places that are uncommon (so think about what your doing).  The snowpack on Antelope Island, for instance, was very thin and much different than up in the Wasatch at 10,000'.  ","","This slide was triggered remotely shortly after the first one. The aspect was the about same (almost due north) and the slope was slightly steeper.  It too broke on facets near the ground.  This slide had much more power and slid about 200 yards.

We stood on top of the slope and discussed if we should ski the slope or not for several minutes.  We chose a less steep line that we felt would be safe to ski.  The first 2 skiers skied the slope and at the bottom stopped in a stand of trees in a safe zone.  Both skiers commented on skiing the debris from a previous slide.  The third skier dropped on in on the same line and about 1/3 of the way down the slope cut right off the debris.  After descending 2/3 of the way down the slope, a powder cloud overtook the skier followed by the avalanche.  The slide was remotely triggered (the skier was well downhill) and was a loose in nature but quickly grew in size, leaving a fairly substantial debris pile.   The skier was able to initially grab onto a tree, but was eventually pulled off.  The 2 skiers at the bottom saw both the slide and powder cloud approaching and immediately knew the slide was of decent size.  The skiers called out for the caught skier.  The skier caught was able to punch his hand through the snow and start calling for help.  The 2 skiers below him immediately began ascending to the caught skier as he was only 100' above them.  The 2 skiers on the top of the slope communicated to the bottom.  The next dropped in, quickly made an assumption that the slope was safe, and arrived at the buried skier at the same time as the 2 skiers from below.  The buried skier was able to dig his own head out so when the first 3 skiers arrived the skiers face was uncovered.  We were able to quickly dig the rest of the buried skier out and by the time the final 2 skiers arrived (1 from the top and another skiing an adjacent line) we had the buried skier out.  The skier lost his ski poles and other than a few scratches and bruises was uninjured.
An interesting note, the buried skier dropped into the slope with his Avalung in his mouth.  After descending over 1/2 way down the slope and getting onto lower angle terrain, he removed the Avalung and was not able to get it back into his mouth once being carried by the slide.
When debriefing after the the day, we reviewed Ian McCammon's Heuristic Traps and didn't feel like we fell into any of the FACETS traps. 

	Hardesty's summary of the day after returning to Alexander with the party on Sunday, January 13
Party of 6 experienced backcountry skiers ascended the Bowman Trail out of Mill Creek to gain the north Gobbler's Knob ridgeline.  They took a lap into the Yellowjacket trees.  They noted one minor collapse and no shooting cracks.  They were aware of the previous day's skier triggered avalanche 14"" deep and 75' wide in Depth Hoar bowl into Alexander Basin.  
Returning to the ridgeline, they decided to ski into Depth Hoar Bowl.  They knew the danger was rated as Considerable for this slope; they knew the snowpack structure, and they knew of the previous day's slide.  They were all good skiers and athletes and followed strict travel protocol (one at a time, getting out of the way at the bottom, and all agreed on the plan).  The first skier dropped in to dig a hand pit and noted that there was only 6-8"" of new snow above the early January facets and decided that if an avalanche occurred, it would be small.  They also felt that the previous day's slide would make it safer; that is, they could find 'shelter' by skiing back into the previous bed surface/runout.   
The first two skiers skiied without incident.  The third, a 43 year old male, was half-way down the slope when he noticed a powder cloud engulfing him just before being overtaken by the debris.  The remotely triggered slide broke perhaps 200' above him 1-2' deep and 125' wide and dragged him down the slope 200' before coming to a stop completely buried except for his hand and the top of his helmet.  Skiers in his party above and below quickly reached him to assess the situation and ensure he had an airway.  Other than a few bumps and bruises and lost ski poles, he was ok.  Photo shows 'X' where skier was overtaken by the debris (actually a bit looker's left)...'O' where he was almost completely buried.
","
Depth Hoar Bowl is aptly named.  It is a steep, cold, sheltered bowl in upper Alexander Basin that faces east to northeast with starting zones at 9300'-9800'.  The snowpack there typically is thin and can often house a conditionally unstable snowpack.  Many vegetative indicators often evidence of continuous avalanching; with perhaps a lone pine on a knoll in the runout zone devoid of any branches below 40' of its trunk. 
","Holiday storms from 12/24-28 brought significant snowfall to the Wasatch Range, with 42"" storm total reported at Alta ski area for that time period.  High pressure followed the storms, lasting through January 10.  During that time, the snow surface became quite weak as the development of surface hoar and near surface faceting became widespread.  Warm conditions, direct sun, and strong southwesterly winds eroded much of the weaknesses on the southerly aspects.  Classic inverted temperatures developed more pronounced weaknesses at the mid and low elevations than the higher elevations.  (Still, this may be splitting hairs...)
Strong southwesterly pre-frontal winds on Wednesday Jan 9th and Thursday Jan 10th signalled the arrival of a cold Pacific storm.  By Thursday afternoon, snowfall began in earnest, and by Saturday morning, storm totals in the upper elevations totalled 14"" with the valleys and mid-elevations receiving as much as 24""!  Gusty southwesterly winds accompanied the storm early on.  Charts below - left indicate no snow for the first week of January and the development of surface facets until the storm on the 10th.  Chart on the right indicates winds spiking on the 9th/10th from the southwest that may have produced a thin wind slab prior to the storm.
","Forecaster Comments: Very glad that things turned out ok for the skier who was caught by the avalanche.  A couple of take home points -

	
		There had been a human triggered slide in the area the day before.  They felt that they could head over toward that slide to use as an area of safety if a slide was triggered.
	
		The first skier did a hand pit and found only 6-8"" of snow above the facets and felt that any avalanche would not be that big.  Unfortunately this was not representative of the depth at the crown.  
	
		The 1st two skiers skied the slope without incident.
	
		They found no cracking or significant collapsing on route.
	
		They were all excellent skiers/riders with a good deal of knowledge of snow and avalanche mechanics...but as the individual mostly buried confided to me - ""We didn't see the forest for the trees.  The big picture was that there was weak snow buried by a big storm on a steep avalanche prone slope with the danger as Considerable.  What else is there to know?""  I think he hits the nail on the head here.  Sometimes our experience/education can give us a laundry list of reasons to ride a dangerous slope that we want to ride while ignoring the bull's eye clues.  

Thanks for the write up gentlemen.  Glad all's ok.  Happens to the best of us.

	The incident began when an 18-year-old rider triggered a small avalanche (most likely a wet sluff) as he descended a steep slope and was taken for a ride.  He lost control of his sled as it flipped over a few times and ended up buried to the handlebars in a gully. The rider was partially buried nearby and was able to self extricate.  A second rider rode his sled down the slope and assisted the first.

	 

	According to information gathered from the father of the second rider, the avalanche was only a small part of the ordeal.   It turns out the pair had descended into a steep ravine that bottomed out in cliffs above the rock quarry at the head of the canyon.  They could not get down due to the cliffs below and they couldn't get back up the steep gully they had descended.

Its epic to say the least. Riding and traveling conditions are stellar. This was a much needed storm for the Skyline, and has greatly improved the snow pack across the region.  
Winds remained calm during and after the storm with almost all aspects having soft settled powder, some exposed peaks and wind features being the exception. A ridge of high pressure is forecasted for the region for the next few days bringing smog to the valleys and sunny skies in the mountains, riding conditions should remain excellent.    
To our surprise the Skyline did not go through a natural avalanche cycle with its new heavy load. However, this means there are a lot of slopes still hanging in balance, just waiting for the unaware rider to come along and trigger an avalanche. 
","In early November the Skyline had a cold dry period lasting a few days, this produced a weak layer that is now buried 3-4 feet deep on all northerly facing aspects.This weak layer (called faceted snow) is weak and unsupportable, especially when you put a heavy load of snow on top. All upper elevation northerly facing slopes should remain suspect for the time being
The main concern would be triggering one of these slab avalanches. These avalanches will be a few hundred feet wide and 3-5 feet deep. (Unmanageable) There is only one way to avoid this danger and that is by terrain choice. 
For the safest riding, stick to gentle slopes generally less than 34 degrees facing the southern half (Sunny Side) of the compass with nothing steeper above or adjacent to you. (Hint) if you own a smart phone, download an inclinometer app or compass (free) this way you can measure slopes angels and know what direction the slope or aspect is facing. Boondocking in the Meadows is also another great powder option.
 
Bottom line: Best to avoid the steep (34 degrees or steeper) shady slopes for now. Tracks on the slope are a poor indicator of stability. South facing slopes with cold powder remain the safest climbing options.

Much of Gobbler's into Porter Fork is thin - total snow depths averaged 3' deep and has well developed facet/crust sandwiches buried 1-2' deep on average.  Crown depths ranged from 10"" to just over 2' deep with slope angles (it rolls at the fracture line) to 40+.  
Let's look at Ian McCammon's Lemons for structure within the snowpack. 

		Concerning Weakness within 1m of snow surface - Check
	
		Persistent Weak Layer - Check
	
		Weak Layer Thickness less than 10cm - Check (roughly 2cm - see photo)
	
		Grain Size difference 1mm or greater - Check 
	
		Hand Harness Difference Greater than 1 step: Check - facets (4F minus) overlying slab - varied from 1F to Pencil​
 
Now for the $69 dollar question - Why there? - particularly with all the tracks nearby?  Good question indeed.  Here are a couple thoughts.

		The Solstice wind event (strong south/southwest winds) resulted in odd loading patterns...perhaps the slab (1F-Pencil) was more pronounced mid-slope.
	
		The facet/crust sandwich is more of a troublemaker at this elevation (9500') rather than much higher...rain is elevation dependent.
	
		Most of the tracks looker's right came after the the event...and perhaps could have well triggered it themselves had it not previously been remoted.

Most likely timing was very early morning on Dec 27.   From a distance and through the clouds it looks to be at least 400' wide with exposed rocks at the ground.  This slope recently avalanched during the storm on Dec 17.  I'm afraid this may be an indication of the lingering instability in the upper elevations of the Provo area mountains.  I spent Thursday on the Timpanogos side of things and did not see any signs of activity during this last storm in the larger paths.  Heading towards Cascade on Sat with hope of getting more of the alpine picture.

Each fracture initiated in the wind-exposed first few feet below upper-elevation ridgetops and only propagated below ski cuts. Though the slabs were on the small side, they were fast-running and entrained unconsolidated snow as they moved.

Miscommunication was the biggest problem today. At the top of our first run my Dad and I were discussing our decent plans and clearly we had different intentions in our minds. We had agreed on skiing the ridge roll and then at a certain point we would poke out carefully onto the side of the main path. He skied first.
 
Dad kept a pretty straight fall line and went out of sight. I started to ski down and was skiers right of his track. I descended about 500 ft when I noticed that I was the only track on the far skiers right of the ridge roll, and I had been separated from my dad. I stopped and let out a yell.....No response. 
 
I quickly scanned the terrain and for sure saw no tracks to my right, so I moved down the slope another 300ft yelling and moving skiers left and came across tracks again. Yelled again, still no response. I continued moving down another 200ft and stopped on the ridge roll and yelled yet again....finally a yell back. 
 
At this point I just stopped and decided to wait here. However, after about five minuets had gone by and not seeing or hearing my dad I yelled again.... and got no yell back this time. Then another five minuets and nothing, I thought no big deal he probably went too low and had to put the skins back on to gain the ridge. After fifteen minuets of no yells back, I started to worry again and decided to drop lower and cut left to find his track. 
 
After dropping another 100ft I came across a fresh debris pile. My heart sank and I quickly started to think the worst. I began to panic and a full hit of adrenaline rushed through my body and my hands began to shake. My world instantly shrunk and I felt all alone, and scared. I ripped out my avalanche beacon and switched it to receive and tried to slow my breathing. My beacon wasn't picking up any signals, it was silent. 
 
I told myself to calm down and think this through. I started by analyzing the debris. As I scanned over the boundary of the avalanche I quickly realized the debris wasn't very deep and only about 35ft wide. It looked as if the avalanche had traveled a long ways down, but never piled up very deep. It looked to be a manageable loose snow avalanche. 
 
Then I saw a set of ski tracks next to the avalanche debris but this didn't make me feel any better because other people were in the area as well. Its possible that it was another persons track. I checked my beacon one more time and listened vary carefully to hear any faint beep....nothing.  
 
I decided I would follow this track down and hopefully find my dad. I turned my beacon back over to transmit and raced downhill next to the track yelling and hoping I would find him at the bottom.
 
When I reached the end of the track, I just found where someone put the skins back on and started climbing uphill. I unstrapped out of my board and raced to split my board from downhill to uphill mode, I extend my poles and put the skins on ready to start hiking. I Stripped all my layers to keep cool because I was panicking and breathing hard.
 
I began to doubt myself. Thoughts of negativity began to overwhelm me “ Should I of searched that debris pile better? Did I just drop too low and have no chance of getting to him in time? These thoughts were painful and I soon took another breath and started to hike. I screamed one last time and finally received a welcomed yell back.
 
Mistakes we made.
 

	
		Not clearly communicating our thoughts properly. I thought we were going to descend the ridge roll and then work right into the open path. Dad clearly was thinking Left into the open path and this split us apart.

 

	
		After we started yelling back and forth, my dad tried to traverse back over to the ridge roll trying to meet back up with me, entering a steep section of trees. This put him in the exact terrain we were trying to avoid.

 

	
		Skiing a steep break-over with no partner or backup. He couldn't make it over to me, so he skied through the trees in a steep slot. On the third turn over a roll he triggered a soft slab avalanche. 3ft deep 50ft wide running 500ft failing above a crust on facets. 

 

	
		Not realizing the shallower snow pack area. This was exactly 9000 ft and was the exact elevation band to have some of the weaker snow, with crusts. Likely spots to trigger an avalanche.   

 

	
		Working as a team. If we had good communication and were working together as a team down the slope, this would of never forced my dad in the steeper trees. Furthermore, if we would of been together on a steep break over we could of stopped and talked about it, before we just skied it. We probably we would of elected to avoid that slope. 

 

	
		Not doing a complete search of the debris pile. While I have mixed feelings on my decision to leave the debris pile. I think this is a situational call and every avalanche is different and each rescue will have its own complications.

 

	
		Letting 5 star powder cloud our judgment.

 
I don't think our terrain choice for the day was the issue. The biggest problem was the miscommunication and being separated from each other. This is what led to the confusion and put us into the terrain we wanted to avoid. 
 
My dad and I had a very warm heart to heart talk and later talked about our mistakes and what we can do next time to better work as a team in avalanche terrain. 
 
As I strive to become a better in the mountains I think its important to look at our mistakes and openly share our experiences. Thankfully this time we get the chance to learn and grow from our mistake. 
 
I would love to hear thoughts and comments on this. But, remember Hindsight is always 20/20 and its easy to pick apart the mistakes of others after the fact. 
 
Please be constructive with positive comments. If its negative don't say anything at all. 
 
Thanks

The Skyline has a big avalanche problem, where avalanches can break into the buried weak layer of faceted snow near the ground. These types of avalanches will be unmanageable and could be triggered from a distance. Best to avoid steep E, N, NE, NW facing slopes steeper than 33 degrees in steepness. Slopes that face the southern half of the compass are generally a safer bet.
Great riding conditions with a supportable base, but don't let that trick you into thinking slopes are stable. The main problem is the extremely weak snow that is now buried 2-4 feet deep in places. Its a house of cards out there right now, its just waiting to come crashing down. The avalanches will be large enough to bury or seriously injury you.
Boondocking in the rock free meadows is the safest bet for now. We avoided all avalanche terrain today. This is a patience game, and right now we need to have some patience, remember its a long season.

Chase's analysis of the slide was that ESE winds from the day before loaded the slope using the island of trees as a snow fence.  The thick part of the slab was clearly skiers right while the thin part was skiers left near where the boarder was riding.  There were tracks going into the thick part of the slab as well as at least 2 sets going into the thin part of the slab.  The slope had been skied by at least 3 people.  Also to note there was a pocket within the slope that had already pulled out.  This pocket was within the new snow only.  With out access to the site after the slide I cannot say if the slope failed on the rain crust about 80cm down or if the slope failed near the ground.  The pictures I took clearly show rocks poking through the snow pack suggesting possibly that the slope failed below the rain crust sandwiches but that may just be a local phenomenom.

We were easily able to get onto the bed surface without having any hangfire above us.  The weakness revolved around the rain crusts from the 4th and the 5th of December, which, now have some faceted grains around them.  The avalanche did not break into the deeper November facets.
Earlier in the day we looked at two other recent avalanches on Square Top along the Park City Ridgeline.  Because of the wind and drifting snow we were not able to positively identify which weak layer failed there.  After we triggered Little Water and considering Ev's avalanche on Reynolds on the 9th which both broke around the rain crusts, we are assuming that Square Top had the same weak layer.
The deal here is that the northwest winds formed a significant enough slab on the east facing slopes.  North slopes were not wind loaded enough.  We suspect that above around 9600' or 9800' the rain crust is not present and the danger is less pronounced.  It seems that east facing slopes along ridges which have just been wind loaded and are sitting between 8500 and 9500 feet is where the hazard is.

I was deliberately ski cutting the top of this slope when a 10' wide, 1' deep, very soft slab released at my feet, running into the choke of the gully below me.  Below the narrowest portion of this slope, the weight of the debris released a wider avalanche below cliff bands on either side of the narrows.  On the skier's right side of this sympathetic release, the slab failed in pooled graupel that likely accumulated during one of the graupel events in the latter half of this week, and the crown in this portion of the slide was about 16 inches deep; on the skiers left side, a 20-foot wide, 2' soft slab failed on the faceted snow that sat atop the snowpack for several weeks in mid/late November.  The debris from this slide entrained quite a bit of snow, ran until the slope angle decreased significantly, and could have buried a person.  Although it was a crowded day in Silver/Days, nobody was in the area when this slide occurred.  

This slide occurred during what was likely the peak of instability during a day of moderate-heavy snowfall.  Several density changes were noted throughout the day, with heavily rimed flakes and clean, angular stellars falling in consecutive periods.  What initially seemed like a short, manageable portion of complex terrain worth navigating in order to harvest the pow-pow below, was in immediate hindsight a perfect spot to activate a couple of distinct buried weak layers.  The ""November Facets,"" which have lacked a sufficient load to propagate clean shears in snowpit tests, showed their potential with the help of significant shock-loading, and I would not be surprised if additional snow-n-blow overnight makes avalanches failing on this layer-as well as wind slabs and storm snow avalanches failing on buried graupel or various crusts-easier to trigger tommorow.  I would consider midslope terrain features, on NW-N-NE facing slopes above about 10,000', which may have been sheltered during recent wind/rain events, to be most suspicious for possible persistent slab avalanches.

At 4:30 pm, the slide looked relatively fresh, as despite active drifting of today's light density snow, the 3-4' deep, ~50' wide crown looked quite sharp, and the extensive debris looked soft.
I called Alta Central to see if this slide had been reported, and quite unfortunately, it had not.

We knew this seasons snow pack history, on going new snow totals, and snow pack structure .  We put the skin track in and monitored it visually to keep tabs on other users.  One other person used it up to Catherine pass.  We did not drop in until the other user was at the pass.  We kept our slope angle low and identified safe spots.  We had good visibility, the run out zone was clear should an avalanche happen.  We thought we would kick a slide off, but we were a bit surprised to see how well the soft slab was connected.  With hard slab failure it is not uncommon to see crowns travel long distances through non uniform terrain, soft slabs however not so much in non uniform terrain.  The snow felt right side up, no wind effect, 4 finger to fist resistance, not very supportable, we could barely make turns on the low angle slope we skied.  We had less than a dozen good turns for the day based on the terrain we chose to ski in/ be in, but we did it safely.

Partner bailed but still went out today with the intent of exploring around Catherine's Pass just to take a look and take one ride out using the low angle terrain near the trail to the pass to get back down to the meadow. Started at 12:30 and got to the pass at 3:00. Since it stopped snowing and began to clear, decided to skin up to the ridgeline for a better view.  Dug 3 pits, one prior in the meadow just for curiosity’s sake, another along the ridge and another towards what I believed to be the top of the run ‘so long’.  After these assessments, it was apparent riding any of these open slopes could be a bad play. By the time I was at what I perceived to be ‘so long’ it was snowing pretty well again and the fatigue that had set in had begun to cloud my judgment. Instead of taking the time to simply use my own skin track back to the meadow, figured I could save time and energy by riding or just hiking down the spine. (Looker’s right of 'so long' utilizing all the trees as anchors.) 

As I started down, I didn’t locate the specific trees I had seen several times before and then realized I was not near so long but actually on sunset, which starts out at even lower angle but has a short, steep section for what I believe was about 20-30 yards to get to the meadow. Attempted 3 turns to release any sluff which it did and released a good bit of snow to my right. So had let that pass and attempted to change direction to exit to my left by crossing the slope and once I did, it released about 5 or so yards above me and was easily able to stop and let the snow pass without issue. 

Took only one photo which is attached and surprised how far it had continued to my left. Again, a bad estimate on distance but would guess 60-80 yards? Rode down to the meadow and out but think about the following mistakes. (1) Should have never been on that north facing slope, especially being well aware of the advisory and previous snow still in place, (2) solo, (3) deviated from original plan, (4) used fatigue and time constraints as an excuse to not backtrack safely, (5) knowingly going into a short, but potential terrain trap, (6) changing direction after releasing the sluff. 

Thought it was important to report and get the appropriate feedback.

I called Alta Central to report the slide and no injuries or burials. 
In hindsight there are several things learned today. 
 The first was that proper communication amongst group members is critical.  Knowing each others route choices, stopping points, order of and location of drop-in, etc.  We were not as organized as we should have been and were fortunate that no one was caught.  I am confident that we would have been able to perform and execute a search and rescue, but I also know that we would not have been as efficient as we should have been due to lack of proper communication before the skiing began; and as we all know, speed and efficiency is paramount to a successful rescue.  
Second is the classic example of jumping into dangerous terrain on a day with some of the best skiing conditions of the year and ""moderate"" danger despite the fact that we all knew of the lingering hazards that have plagued our snow-pack this year.  As with everyone out there, we were chomping at the bit to get into steeper terrain and jump off of something.  It goes to show that you can be conservative all year long, but it only takes one error in judgement to cause a situation that could potentially be fatal.

Two local snowboarders were riding at Snowbird Ski Resort when one of them triggered an inbounds avalanche on upper Blackjack, a west-facing slope on Peruvian Ridge. As the rider started to descend the slope, he felt the snow start to move around him. He attempted to get away from the moving snow, but he was unable to move off of the slope. He descended to the slopes below the traverse in main Blackjack, where he came to rest on the surface of the debris. The snowboarder suffered injuries as a result from the ride. A skier on the traverse below heard the noise from the oncoming snow and traversed out of the way of the slide. 
The slide was witnessed by people in the area. A lift supervisor witnessing the slide from across the way called Hidden Peak dispatch on the radio while the slide was in motion.

Rescue:
When the chair lift supervisor witnessing the slide sounded the alarm, the ski patrol on Hidden Peak dispatched a search team, who arrived at the scene within three minutes of dispatch.  As the patrol responded, they asked bystanders to close gates to restrict access, and quickly took control of the scene. UDOT personnel were on the radio, and acted as an avalanche guard from the highway as the hasty team started the search. The patrol could see one victim on the surface of the snow and started to look for any other people involved. After Transceiver, Recco, visual search for clues, probing and rescue dogs searched the area, they determined no one else was involved and concluded the search. Meanwhile a ski patrol medical team responded to aid the victim. After assessing the injuries they packaged and transported him to an ambulance waiting on the highway below where he was transferred to the medical center in Salt Lake City.

I was about ten turns in when I saw a crack appear underneath my skis; by the next turn, I could see the southern flank of the slab pulling out from a steeper, more northerly terrain feature, about 100 feet to my left and 200 feet downslope.  The slide ran into a dense aspen grove, audibly snapping trees up to four inches in diameter.  My group of three used the gentle ridge on the N side of this terrain feature to descend, following our skin-track, and we were able to access the debris, making sure there was no evidence other people had been in the runout.  We did not approach the crown of this slide.   We made a few serious mistakes yesterday.  First, we ignored, or failed to take seriously, obvious signs of instability.  Along the ridge, we felt a couple relatively small, isolated collapses; we told each other they seemed like they were coming from underneath obvious wind drifts, which themselves were covered in roughly 10 inches of light density, settled, deceptively un-wind-affected snow.  Furthermore, we could not see obvious signs of recent avalanches in lower and middle Mineral Fork, although clouds obscured the Room of Doom all morning.  At a location where the slope measured 30 degrees and an altimeter read 8300', we walked onto the slope to dig a pit.  In 140 cm of snow, we found a Q2 shear, ECTP 15, 75cm from the ground, on very small facets underneath a 1F MF crust.  At 60 cm from the ground, we found another Q2, ECTP 23, failing on similarly small facets beneath what I believe was a pencil hard, 2mm thick rain/rime crust from 2/21 or 2/22.  There was no dirt layer or late-december rain crust at this location.  The snowpit was a couple hundred feet to the north of where this avalanche occurred, and probably 200 vertical feet below the highest portion of the crown, but I am confident the slide ran on one of the shears we found in our snowpit.   Our second, more serious error, was in choosing terrain we had only developed an impression of, without really knowing its characteristics.  No one in our party had been on this slope before yesterday, although one member of the group and I have remarked on previous occasions that it looked like a great run.  Upon reaching the slope yesterday, I thought it looked ""low angle,"" and several slope angle measurements along the flank of the slope adjacent to our up-track were in the low 30's.  In yesterday's flat light, it was easy to look all the way across the slope without identifying any terrain features that seemed to be likely spots for an avalanche to release.  We projected our slope angle measurements to the open expanse of the slope to our right.  After being highlighted by a large crown and mangled bed surface, a broad, very shallow gully in the middle of the face, just to the skiers left of my intended descent route became obvious.  I consciously took the appearance of a dense thicket of middle-aged aspens directly at the base of the slope to indicate that this slope rarely, if ever slid.  Indeed, it would seem that full-track avalanches on this slope are rare, yet historically occasional events, as just a few, well flagged spruces--with generations of smaller aspen trunks piled up against them--are resident in this stand of forest.","","","Photos from pba's observation of this avalanche show that I was much closer to the highest portion of the crown than I could tell from above it, or from lower in the drainage, looking back."

Looking through binos I could see some ski tracks just right of the slide on a safer shoulder (good terrain management fellas). There were not tracks going into the slide and the skier tracks from the right appeared to have cleared the debris. I assume the slide occured naturally because of the rapid warming, but may have been also remotely triggered by the skier party. (Unknown).  I'm hoping I can upload some of these photos.

The Accident: 
A group of 4 individuals from the Norwood, Colorado area decided to  go on a snowmobile tour from Gateway, Colorado and up into Beaver Basin  in the La Sal Mountains, Utah.  They started in the early morning.  It  was the first time to Beaver Basin of the season for the group leader,  who had been there twice before.  Another member of the party  snowmobiled in the area once before.  On their way to Beaver Basin, the  party did not notice any signs of instability.  Once in the basin  proper, snow conditions were getting deeper and on numerous occasions,  the more experience riders needed to circle back around to assist the  less experienced digging their snowmobiles out.  
The summer road did not have any noticeable snowmobile tracks, as  they continued up the group leader realized that they were entering a  land of diminishing returns...the amount of stuck snowmobiles and tough  going warranted the party to turn around.  But where?  
The first sign of instability the party encountered were roller balls  off a cliff band (avalanche terrain) less that 1/8 a mile from the  accident site.  The summer road in that area was too steep to stop (they  did not want to get stuck) to regroup and the group leader remembered a  meadow that could work as turn around point and regrouping area.   Unfortunately, this meadow was where the accident occurred.  The summer  road into Beaver Basin is affected by numerous avalanche paths, and this  clearing was a result of the classic avalanche path looming above. 
The first two snowmobiles crossed the avalanche path and regrouped on  the other side in the more protected part of the meadow.  As the third  snowmobile made its way across, the first two started to see ""snow dust""  coming down the avalanche path and waved the third on.  As the third  made it to the first two, the fourth snowmobile (victim) crested over  the top of the steep hill and into the avalanche path.  Vigorously  waving for him to cross, the ""snow dust"" turned into a powder cloud and  then debris and powder cloud obscured their vision for over 30 seconds.   Once the snow settled, the fourth snowmobile and his rider was nowhere  to be seen.  The party started to search for their partner immediately. 
Unfortunately, the party only had one beacon, one probe and two  shovels.  They started their search from the last seen point and  realized the force of the avalanche pushed the victim off the bench the  summer road was on and into a classic terrain trap: a steep gully.  They  had a very good feeling where he was buried: probed all over the place,  yet their probe could not reach the bottom of the debris (which in some  places was over 30' deep).  There was a potential probe strike:  the  party dug a six foot hole in this location...they were losing time.   Approximately 1 hr 45 min elapsed during this search and the party  realized they were outmatched to find their companion.  They left and  found cell service way down John Brown's Canyon on the way to Gateway.   The accident occurred around 10:30 am and Grand County Search and Rescue  received the call on 2:00 pm. 
The Rescue/Recovery: 
On Saturday afternoon, a hasty team of Grand County Winter Search and  Rescue members were flown in to the site.  The hasty team probed in  likely areas along the bench and in the ravine.  Once likely burial  areas were probed, a coarse probe search started from the last scene  point downhill while one of the hasty members continued to probe likely  areas in the ravine.  On a hunch (and a bit of luck) the spot probe  decided to probe the bottom of the hole already dug by the snowmobile  party.  It was determined a positive strike was made.  All efforts then  were diverted to determining the probe strike.  Upon digging to the end  of the probe utilizing the conveyor method, the cowling of the  snowmobile was uncovered.  No other actions could be done at this time  due to darkness and the victim was not positively found. 
On Sunday morning, March 4th, a large group of Mesa County and Grand  County Search and Rescue team members arrived on scene shortly after  10:00 am.  Over 50 rescuers contributed their time and effort in the  search.  In the beginning of the search, one team probed the entire  slide path along the bench below the last scene point while the second  group started to move a metric ton of avalanche debris below.  Once  the upper area was cleared, all rescue team members contributed to  digging out the victim and his snowmobile.  By noon, the victim was  identified and by 1300 was removed from the accident site.  He was found  approximately 3 feet uphill from his snowmobile and under at least 12'  of avalanche debris.

We were on the sub-peak of reynolds directly to the east of the summit. We planned to ride back down along the spine of the ridge between the south and east facing slopes but stopped to dig a pit just for a bit of education of how the main face was most likely set up. We found the full gamut of layers, with significant failures on an isolated block on some depth hoar about 3 feet down, as well as some lighter failures at the top of the more dense snow  from earlier this week (most likely wind slab, which was found about 2 feet down) and just above a melt-freeze crust about 4 feet down. Once we finished up with the pit I began to descend directly down the spine of the ridge, along the border of the trees. About 5 turns down, I dropped about 2 feet off to skiers right (onto the south face) to get around a tree and stopped to wait for my partner. At this point I noticed a very large sympathetic slide running, at about 100-200 feet into the slope from where I had just skied. It looked to be about 200-300 ft wide at the widest point of propagation, with highly variable crown that was anywhere from centimeters to 2.5-3 ft deep to my eye. It ran down through the trees and the full length of the slide path, into the valley below the peak. It looked to be a soft slab, with several large blocks of the crown dispersed around the starting point. I suspect it failed somewhere in the wind slabs that we had noticed before.   Glad I've honed in my skills enough to know that that slope was sure to slide, this certainly confirmed that hunch. Great turns were had on safer, lower aspect skiing all around Reynolds. Let me know if you have any further questions!   Regards Nick","","",""

Accident & Rescue Summary                                                                     March 3, 2012
 
One snowboarder caught, carried and injured.
 
Two local snowboarders were riding at Snowbird Ski Resort when one of them triggered an inbounds avalanche on upper Blackjack, a west-facing slope on Peruvian Ridge. As the rider started to descend the slope, he felt the snow start to move around him. He attempted to get away from the moving snow, but he was unable to move off of the slope. He descended to the slopes below the traverse in main Blackjack, where he came to rest on the surface of the debris. The snowboarder suffered injuries as a result from the ride. A skier on the traverse below heard the noise from the oncoming snow and traversed out of the way of the slide.
 
The slide was witnessed by people in the area. A lift supervisor witnessing the slide from across the way called Hidden Peak dispatch on the radio while the slide was in motion.
 
Rescue:
 
When the chair lift supervisor witnessing the slide sounded the alarm, the ski patrol on Hidden  Peak dispatched a search team, who arrived at the scene within three minutes of dispatch.  As the patrol responded, they asked bystanders to close gates to restrict access, and quickly took control of the scene. UDOT personnel were on the radio, and acted as an avalanche guard from the highway as the hasty team started the search. The patrol could see one victim on the surface of the snow and started to look for any other people involved. After Transceiver, Recco, visual search for clues, probing and rescue dogs searched the area, they determined no one else was involved and concluded the search. Meanwhile a ski patrol medical team responded to aid the victim. After assessing the injuries they packaged and transported him to an ambulance waiting on the highway below where he was transferred to the medical center in Salt Lake City.

The avalanche was 300 ft wide 2-3 ft deep and ran pretty far taking out a few tracks from yesterday. 
Not sure if this avalanche was a natural or triggered remotely by the party that pushed the up track up the head wall early this morning. Possibly this was the party that was caught in a avalanche in West Porter area. This was not the avalanche that caught and buried someone one I think. The avalanche that I took a picture of might be the slide the party was caught in but, I searched the bed surface looking for tracks and also looked up at the crown and saw no tracks. However, this is all speculation on my part.","","","This was the up track that was covered by either a natural or remotely triggered slide. In the forecast this morning Drew mentioned to be wise in terrain choices and the best tool for avoiding avalanches is to stay off slopes approaching 32 degrees and steeper. This up track went straight up the head wall on a slope that was easily steeper than 35 degrees and was loaded up with plenty of new snow.
I also saw many other backcountry travelers punching lines steeper than 35 degrees and it was a miracle that only one person took a ride. SLOW DOWN PEOPLE. THE HILL WE BE THERE NEXT YEAR........ WILL YOU?

As  he was coming down the he made a sidehill cut under some trees.  The  terrain is rocky and the snowpack there was shallow.  The slide  propagated the slope and it crowned out about 30 feet above him at the  ridgeline in the trees.  Crown looked to be 2.5-3 feet in height.   Failed on the february crust layer.  Slide was probably 40-50 feet in  width and traveled maybe 200-250 feet.  

I may or may not have footage of the slide, havent checked yet, and  soon as i recognized what was happening the camera was thrown down to  get out essentials for rescue.  He was buried at the toe of the slide.  probably about 1 -2 feet down.  I had my shovel out and ready and beacon  out before the slide even stopped moving.  Where my probe was supposed  to be it was gone, it must have fallen out of its holster earlier in the  day.  Was not a good feeling.  He had an airbag, but kept missing the  handle.  I kept eyes on him and was able to see either his back pack or  helmet sticking out as the slide came to rest.  By the time i had ran  the 60 feet to get to the spot, he was able to lift his head out of the  snow.  Had him fully extracted in about 2 minutes.  No harm or injury to  rider or machine.  Just a good learning experience.

2 things I wanted to comment about.  The first is familiarity with  the terrain.  We ride the area all the time, checked the reports this  morning, and knew what we were up against.  There were signs of other  slides (that went in the storm) and we had heard two large ones come  down earlier.  Had he not cut across into the rockier terrain I believe  the slide would stil be there waiting to get someone.  Its in a high  traffic area, and covered the usual trail in and out. Goal was to stay  out from underneath any terrain traps, and we were in no way going near  the usual avy zones.  Just happened to cut the wrong spot.  Unusual  year, with unusual snow pack.  Best be extra cautious.

The other thing i wanted to mention was training.  When it all  started happening, there was a strong urge to panic.  I took 2 big deep  breaths, and remembered all my training.  I was able to clear my head  and get my gear ready very very quickly.  Luckily I didnt have to probe  or shovel too much (it was just me and him out there).  I cannot  emphasize enough how critical the training is.  Without it, i probably  would have panicked and locked up.  Looking forward to helping out again  this year in educating others.

Ride safe out there and thanks again for all your hard work!

This ridge was about 25 degrees in steepness and the safest option for descent.  The first two skiers descended one at a time along the ridge.  They described the snow on the east side of the ridge as pillowy and wind-loaded.  Every time they felt one of these pillows they veered west.  The third skier skied on top of their tracks and the avalanche released at 9000 feet and propagated up another 50 feet and over onto the slope about 100 feet.   No one was caught. The last skier and I were still at the top of the ridge and watched the slope release.  It ran about 800 feet and took out the entire snow pack, which was basically just 1.5-2 feet of new snow.  This was easily a size 3 avalanche.  We had skied SE aspects in Bear Trap Fork earlier in the day and had some settling on a 15 degree slope, but no snow movement.  We didn't ski anything over 30 degrees today.  When we were on Reynolds, the south face was probably around 35 or a little steeper and we decided not to ski it.

Neither of the skiers had avalanche equipment or any avalanche training.    They did report being aware of the reported avalanche danger from the  UAC.  As they were skiing along the ridgeline the first skier took a  few turns off the ridge and was heading back to the ridge when the slab  broke.  The skier behind  was also caught on the slab.  Brinton  immediately got off the slab and stopped on the bed surface.  Fred rode  the slab a little farther before getting on the bed surface and then  eventually stopped when he caught a tree.  Fred lost a ski early in the  slide.  At this time they started heading down the avalanche path to  retrieve the lost ski.  Due to the steepness and the firm slick bed  surface they traversed out to their left to find a different way into  the debris pile.  They eventually made their way to the debris pile to  find a search in progress.  After a discussion with rescuers it was  determined that no other individuals were involved in the avalanche.   All involved parties at this point skied out safely to the parking lot.
Both skiers mentioned having some concern with skiing steeper  terrain due to avalanche hazard.  Skiing along the ridge they made just a  few turns in to the top of the avalanche path intending to just make a  few powder turns and then regain the ridge, but that was all it took.   They also mentioned that in hindsight they should have ascended back to  the ridge and walked down the safer ridgeline to find a safe way to the  debris pile.
Rescue:
Reports of an avalanche in the Toilet bowl, it was at first  uncertain if any one was involved.  Dispatch eventually received a call  form people on scene stating that they were on scene and there was one  ski in the debris pile.  The group on scene performed a beacon search  with no find and then began to probe the area.  Patrol organized an  initial search team of Will King, G.R Fletcher, Jedidiah Getzlaff, and  Hans Hjelde with avalanche search dog Pivot.  The search team skied to  the top of the path.  Hans and pivot did a dog search of the area.  Will  and G.R performed a beacon Search while probing likely burial areas.   Jedidiah did the recco search.  Probing of dog interest areas going on  when the individuals involved skied to the debris pile.  It was  determined that they triggered the avalanche and no one else was  missing.
Avalanche
AS-O-R3D3 average crown size two feet with a max of three feet, east  facing 8500’ 130’wide running 800 vertical feet (crown and weak layer  estimated from quick descent down avalanche path).  Observations of that  path five days earlier reported very thin weak faceted snow.  The path  in question has slid numerous times throughout the season.  This  avalanche failed on facets near the ground.  A recent storm of 19” with  1.43 H2O put a new load on a structurally weak snowpack.  The avalanche  released with the weight of two skiers.

Cutting right the slope released at the new snow/old snow interface from the last two storms. It immediately wrapped left around a rock band and stepped down below the one finger bed surface. Collapse failure occurred below this crust and it propagated 350 feet to the riders left. The crown propagated upslope to the left at least 85 feet higher in steeper untraveled terrain, and then the propagation followed the contours of the terrain and descended about 350 feet to the left. The slope cutter was never in danger moving to the right and on lower angle terrain. Upon inspection of the crown face it became apparent that the slide stepped down. The initial release point was on a slope that has seen a lot of traffic. The propagation area also has seen traffic. We were the only people in the area at this time. The slope ran to the transition/bench below and the debris fanned out as it came down and wrapped around a large feature. There was 16 inches of fist (new snow from the last two events), then one inch of one finger, two inches of intermediate facets, then one inch of one finger, and then at least 4 inches of advanced facets. Below this faceted layer was the bed surface of the step down and this layer was pencil hard. There were areas where the total depth was 3 feet. Further South on the same ridge line there was another rider triggered slide on a similar aspect. This one was at least 180 feet wide, maybe more. I only got a look at it after descending much later in the day and the light was poor. Reports from the Brighton Patrol indicated the slide was reported and all were safe.

They reported it to the Alta Ski Patrol, which we all greatly appreciate. Then, they wisely decided to quite riding for the day.
Brett Kobernik and I took a look at it a day after it was triggered.  There have been a lot of avalanches triggered and collapsing reported on south facing slopes, so we were curious about the culprit weak layer.  In fact, the gentle, bottom part of the avalanche runout below the debris collapsed on us as we approached from the bottom.  The culprit was caught red handed--or rather, white weak-layered in this case.
Despite lots of digging, Brett and I were disappointed that we could not find any clear smoking gun, but the weak layer appeared to be a subtle, hard-to-identify-and-see, weak layer above a sun crust.  Despite lots of microscope work, we're still not sure what the weak layer was but there was a very thin layer of some very small faceted crystals present on top of the sun crust and I thought I saw some surface hoar at times.  Whatever it is, it was disappointedly subtle and left us scratching our heads (the real reason I'm bald).  We also dug where we got the collapse and were heartbroken not to identify any clear culprit.  Whatever it was, it's doing a lot of collapsing and avalanching so it has to be some kind of monkey business (persistent weak layer such as facets or surface hoar).  It's still a mystery, at least to our puny brains--despite about 50 years of professional experience between us.
The bottom line is that the snowpack is extremely complex right now with multiple weak layers and a very complex history.  It's hard to trust very much.
We also saw several other slabs of the same vintage on south facing slopes in the area--most appeared to be wind slabs on steep slopes.  We also dug in one northeast facing avalanche fracture and still did not see any weak layer that was too obvious--just a thin, small-grained faceted layer probably from February.  It preferred to break on this unimpressive layer rather than the large-grained, impressive depth hoar near the ground.  I suspect that the rapid loading from Wednesday night reactivated some subtle layers that would normally be sleeping.
I will add photos and perhaps a video and perhaps a snow profile later...  But it's late and it may have to wait till morning."," Finally, we saw the remotely triggered slide in east-facing Eagle Run triggered by WPG as they traversed on the flats above the slope.  We did not get up to take a look at it, but I would guess it was a wind slab on graupel.  ",""," We also looked at a north-facing slab of similar dimensions and it broke on the February facets, but they were very small-grained and not obvious.  "

This is information is from talking with the Canyons ski patrollers who responded to the accident and a visit to the site by UAC forecasters Evelyn Lees and Brett Kobernik.  More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.
The accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.
Timothy and his partner were on snowboards.  They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south   It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs.  Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche.  He was caught, carried and buried.  Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.
Rescue:  Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching.  As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived.  One was sent for help.  The other 7 people searched the debris.  None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers  arrived on the scene.  Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR.  They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.
The victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide.  He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep.  The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. 
 
email from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed
I was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday.  Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself.  Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort.  It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well.  It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist.  They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue.  There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident.  Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved.  Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome.  The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment.  Take care and be safe! Cheers, ","","","","","","This accident happened in Forest Service backcountry terrain often referred to as ""sidecountry"" because of its close proximity to the ski resort.  It is clearly marked when you leave the Canyons Ski Resort and even though it is VERY close to the ski resort, it should be treated as all other backcountry terrain."

Got to the bottom and I was now moving fast, 60+ mph, and realized there is a big pile of snow at the bottom and I am now going airborne. Squared up the best I could and took some air off a 5' slab kicker! Got some air and landed hard but I was know out of the danger zone. I am very grateful that nobody was hurt. I didn't need to deploy the bag, but its better to be safe than sorry. Interested point. I got to the bottom and thought, ""stupid airbag didn't event deploy.""

I'm guessing it ran sometime towards the end of the storm on 2/12 or 2/13, as the debris still looked fresh.  This is either a repeater on a weakness leftover from the 1/20-1/22 cycle, or a slide on buried surface hoar from 2/3-ish.    Significant debris from yesterday's wet-loose activity originating in steep SE facing cliffs above Bonkers.","","",""

Rider B said that they were out boondocking for the day with no intention of doing any hill climbing.  He was very aware of the dangerous weak snow near the ground as well as the recent snowfall which had created a slab which had produced a recent widespread natural avalanche cycle.
At the end of the day, the group was going to exit the backcountry and they were looking for the fastest route out.  They chose to utilize a summer road that crossed an avalanche path.  Rider B had traveled down the road the previous week and his tracks were still visible.  It was 5pm or a little later.  He started up the road and was about half way across the path when he felt the entire pack move.  The next thing he knew, he was being pushed off the road.  He then said that snow was washing over him and he was engulfed.  Luckily, he was not knocked off the sled and was able to grab a full handful of throttle which propelled him back out of the churning snow and he was able to ride to safety.
When he came to a stop, riders C and D were on the opposite side of the path and had not been caught.  Rider A was no where to be seen.  They speculated that Rider A had been following Rider B and had been buried but none of them had seen him get caught.
 
Rider B and C turned their transceivers to receive and started the search.  They stated that there were some problems with cell phone interference and turned off their cell phones.  They were at the toe of the slide and started to walk uphill with their transceivers searching for a signal.  They were unable to locate an initial signal.  After an hour, it was decided that they needed to get outside help and ultimately, rider B rode to a location where his cell phone worked and called for help.  Upon his return, the group was able to spot part of Rider A's sled just sticking out of the snow.  It was well after dark at this point.  Upon nearing the buried sled, both transceivers started to receive a signal.  At this point, they quickly located Rider A who was buried under at least 4 feet of snow and downhill of the buried sled by about 50 feet.  They dug him up but it was too late.
 
 ","","","","","","Comments:  Rider B is very perplexed as to why neither he nor Rider C didn't pick up an initial signal quickly.  Rider B states they walked very close to where Rider A was found and did not receive a signal until later when they returned back down the path.

Rider B was very adamant about staying off steep slopes during the day.  He stated that they would climb the avalanche slope under more stable conditions but were not willing to do it this season.  He admits that it was foolish to use the road which cuts through the path.  He states that their choice was made out of being tired and wanting to head home the quickest way.

To me, this is an easy mistake to make.  The road is a very pronounced cut through the slope which I could see could give a false sense of security, although Rider B openly states he knew better.  Taking short cuts while being fatigued is a common theme in accidents and is a very easy mistake to make. These guys were correct in avoiding any hill climbing because of known avalanche danger but the rush to get ""back to the barn"" caused them to chance crossing the exact slope that they were not willing to climb.  Thank you Rider B for being willing to talk about this incident which, hopefully, others can learn from."

We rode many other mellow slopes throughout the day with no signs of instability.  Pit tests looked pretty good all around.  I got an ECTP 26 on a 22 degree west facing slope earlier in the day.  The failure occurred about 2 inches below the faceted/2-week-old snow interface.   Another pit in a similar area didn’t produce any CT failures.  It was interesting to note that the facets near the ground are becoming slightly more rounded and look like they are beginning to bond.

""Skier A and skier B skinned up flagstaff to access Days fork. There were two ski tracks dropping into Days fork via the ENE aspect in a slighty treed area and a skin track in the same area coming back up out of Days fork. Skier A dropped first staying in the same area as the two tracks and the skin track. Skier B dropped the same area. Both skiers then skinned back up the existing skin track. About 30 feet from the ridgeline skier B decided to dig a pit so skier A made his way up towards the ridge to a safe spot. Skier B then traversed out from the skin track and onto slightly steeper slope to dig a pit. Skier B had enough time to take his skis off and get his shovel and saw out before a 2.5' slab broke about 20 feet above him and propagated 150' to the south. Skier B struggled to run up the slab and get out but was not able to escape. Skier B took a ride to the bottom of the slope. Luckily ending up on top and uninjured. Skier A then dropped to skier B to assist in locating gear, able to find everything except shovel, saw and skis.""

The avalanche took out the climbing track and all the ski tracks.

Jake stumbled onto the avalanche shortly after and saw the tracks at the bottom which came out of the debris and then their original climbing track back in.  He was unable to see where they exited the the crown at the top of the slope and feared it had avalanched on them as they were ascending, burying both of them.  WBR and WPG were quickly put into action and initiated a search.  After putting people on the debris and doing a recco & beacon sweep, no signals were found and it was determined that someone had boot hiked back up the slide path.

If you trigger an avalanche like this, PLEASE contact Alta Central (801-742-2033) so that time and money are not wasted in needless searches as well as putting rescuers in difficult situations for no reason.

Last, this slide path is statistically one of the most active in our region with countless close calls.  It has become common that a climbing track is put in the avalanche path.  This is an unsafe practice for obvious reasons.
","","","From Jake's view: ""Was extremely hard to tell exactly what had happened from the ridge, but adjacent paths had me extremely reluctant to jump into the slope. A number of phone calls to various agencies quickly confirmed no one knew about this slide. I then activated WBR through Alta Dispatch. The slide is a repeater, but interestingly the dirt layer is present in the crown, leading me to believe the slide pulled out hangfire from the previous avalanche triggered by Drew and Kow last week. Pleasantly surprised to get the whole story on this, the bed surface was mostly rock and ground and the crown pulled onto the ridge in a few spots. A few more pics below.""

Jake is correct, crown face was low from when Hardesty and I triggered it leaving lot's of hang fire.

On the morning of Saturday January 28th four people in two cars drove up Big Cottonwood Canyon with the intent to climb the Argenta Slide Path. About 1500’ into the climb, one member of the party didn’t feel well and headed back to his car to return home. The three remaining, one skier (Josh A.) and two split-boarders (Alecs B. and Justin S.), pressed on. They gained the ridge, bumped into a well-known local skier, where they stopped and talked for a few minutes.  The three then headed south towards a steep, committing run north of the “Little Giant” located of the west face of Kessler Peak. Alecs Barton was in the lead and dropped into the slope while the other two maintained their spacing and watched their partner. Alecs descended through some trees and we he popped out onto the open slope he triggered a hard slab avalanche about 100’ above him at approx 11:22. The slide averaged  3’ deep, was nearly 1000’ wide and ran 2,500’ vertically.
After Alecs disappeared, Josh and Justin quickly formulated a game plan and began descending the narrow couloir.  Half way down the chute they encountered a 30’ plus cliff band they had to negotiate. The two continued down slope and encountered yet another cliff band where they decided to call 911 at 11:29 while they still had a cell signal. Josh continued down slope into the avalanche debris filled gully. He got a signal, continued downhill, but quickly realized he was below his partner as the signal faded. He hiked uphill as Justin arrived and began probing. The first strike was a false positive and as Josh shoveled he realized he had hit a tree branch. Justin continued probing and struck Alecs foot moments later. The digging began and they uncovered his legs followed by the rest of his body. Josh and Justin began CPR. At this juncture the Wasatch Powderbird Guides (WPG) helicopter was heard in the canyon, but Josh and Justin noticed it was heading up canyon and away from them. Josh decided to pull his ABS so the heli could more easily spot them from the air. Within a few minutes the heli returned, was above them, and dropped off two members of Wasatch Backcountry Rescue (WBR) who assisted on scene.
Given the terrain features this was remarkable rescue by not only the trained professionals of WPG and WBR, but also from Josh and Justin who maintained composure under extremely difficult physical and emotional conditions. The mere fact that they were able to negotiate the extremely challenging terrain which barely had enough snow left in it and continue with a solid well managed rescue is a testament to these two young men’s background in both mountaineering and medical training.
All members of the party had avalanche rescue gear. It’s unclear if Alecs had consulted the avalanche advisory that morning, but he had been in the general area a few days before and was aware of the snowpack structure on nearby slopes. No snow pits were dug, but survivors indicated they tested the snow throughout the tour with pole stabs and felt good about stability. Both Alecs and his splitboarding partner were familiar with the terrain and had descended the slope at least once last season.","",""," On the day of the avalanche, the advisory's bottom line read, ""Very dangerous conditions exist in the backcountry.
There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for triggering deep slab avalanches and a MODERATE danger for triggering any new or old wind drifts. It’s not HIGH danger anymore, but the travel recommendations remain the same. I’d avoid the steep west to north to southeast facing slopes at the mid and upper elevations.  
It went on to say, ""t’s gonna be one of those days - Bluebird, light wind, 5 star powder (for this year anyway). Truth be told, it’s also days like these where we see avalanche accidents. Discipline, self-denial – these are things we not only aspire to – it’s what keeps us alive in conditions like these. Even – perhaps especially – if you see other tracks on the slope. Or that others are getting away with it. It has applications in other parts of our lives as well.""","","","Looking down the path of debris, WPG set their ship down near the closest arrow about 75' uphill of where Alecs' partners located him."

He waited till his partners were in a safe spot but then skied  diagonal across the slope to the spot where his ski track enters the  flank. He catches a small air and upon landing the slide releases well  above him..He outruns the slide as its momentum slows significantly once  it hits the stauchwall .

This  afternoon I observed a large, skier triggered avalanche that apparently  occurred this afternoon on skier's right, west-facing Holy Toledo.   Viewing only from an oblique angle atop Toledo Face, size was difficult  to estimate, but the crown looked at least 16"" deep all the way across  and encompassed roughly half the breadth of the steep, shrubby open  slope north of Toledo Saddle.  Grass and recently characteristic facet  gouging was evident in the bed surface, even from so far away.  A solid  size 2 debris pile left hefty chunks of hard slab one of my favorite  lunch spots, in the flat between Holy Toledo and the Eyebrow.
Although moderate NW winds were transporting enough snow to erase  whatever tracks the involved skiers left above the crown, four very  fast-looking tracks emerged at the toe of the slide, and a friend skiing  on the Eyebrow when the incident occurred suggests the final skier in a  party of four trigger the avalanche.
On many upper elevation slopes evidence of recent large natural  avalanches is at or near the snow surface with expansive crowns present  on most northwest- thru north- thru east-facing slopes, obvious debris  piles beneath start zones, and snow-coated tree trunks from big powder  blasts and debris flow.
West-facing snow has been under strong solar influence today and  yesterday, and I imagine the warmth of this slope contributed to its  collapse.

We immediately believed someone was buried and prepared to assist with rescue with our beacons, probes, and shovels.  The men on top then yelled down that no one was buried.  Evidently two riders started to climb Whiskey.  The leading rider triggered the slab just has he reached the top.  He rode off of the last slab and slammed into the wall left behind (crown face) bending his handlebars to the windshield.  His buddy below was able to turn out and outrun the slide, which was amazing because of the thick trees at the base of Whiskey.  They were both very lucky.  We were glad to not have to be involved in a rescue.  Turns out the two riders just wanted help pulling the sled just below the slab wall over the top.  With 8 riders and a lot of rope, we hoisted the sled over the top.
I can't believe the two attempted to climb Whiskey that day with the avalanche danger rate High on your site.  More questionable was the fact that both were climbing together.  Had they both been buried, we would have observed the slide and moved on, with no knowledge of the slide being human triggered.   The state should require avalanche safety courses as part of the snowmobile registration process.

I was in the Hidden Canyon avalanche of 1-22-12  I would like you all  to  know that the group was 3 snowboarders and one skier.  Only 2 of us  were caught in the slide.   No one was partially buried and no one  required assistance to become  unburied.  The two caught in the slide  self rescued via death grip on a  tree.  All four people in the group  have had avalanche training.  We  also knew that this avalanche cycle is  one of the worst ever.  It is  true we didnt have our avy gear with us.   So yes we did f*@# up in that  aspect, but beacons and shovels wouldnt  have saved me or my buddy if  we had gone much further down the slide  path because those trees and  cliffs would have smashed the life out of  us,
The group did not intend to ski into Hidden Canyon, we were traversing   when the avy hit.  Our plan was to traverse above the chutes and ski the   ridge line between Lack-o-waxen and Hidden Canyon with the ultimate   goal of skiing some low angle trees off of 10420.
Looking back at what we did wrong, and I know from everyone out there that this is a long list so I won't hit on the obvious.
First , we should have hiked straight up Claytons Peak from the chair   lift and then we would have been on the ridge line without having to   traverse above Brown Spot (The Hidden Canyon Headwall).
Second, as crazy as this sounds If i had been on skis, I believe this   slide would not have happened.  Because, as we traversed above the   chutes the skier in our group was able to maintain a high traverse and   was safely above the crown.  The slide was triggered when 2 of us   (snowboarders) stopped together at a spot way too low off the ridge.
Thirdly,  our spacing on the traverse was really bad. when the 2 of us   stopped next to each other the weight of both of us together triggered   the slide.
Original report:
Brighton Patrol received report of a avalanche in the Hidden Canyon sidecountry area around 11AM. They reported a group of four was on the slope when it slide. All 4 were caught and carried. 2 partially buried, but uninjured.
They knew the hazard was HIGH, but stated they were more aware now. They carried no rescue gear although at least one had rescue gear in the car.

As such, I chose a safe zone skier's right and behind a large rock, approximately 30 vertical feet down.  Dropping in, nothing happened as I made my first turn, but as I made a second turn, to my right towards the safe zone, the slide was triggered.  My guess is that the wind-loaded top layer broke and stepped down to the subsequent two layers below.  The resulting multilayer hard slab propagated above, to the flatter ridgetop, as well as 30 feet skier's left and 10 feet skier's right.  Vertically, the slab released was likely around 80'.  Right and left boundaries of the slide path seemed dictated by terrain features:  significant rock outcroppings.  Debris traveled downhill at least 250 vertical feet, stopping as terrain flattened.  Following the slide, further analysis suggested significant energy between the bed surface and failing layer.  The slope was measured around 37 degrees.  Other than the trigger, there was no human involvement.

Michelle & I went up this morning (12/13/11) to poke around and see
what was going on up there.. did not bring the ski's just went on the
sleds. as of around 11:30 this morning there was around 8'"" of new on
our way out  to dark canyon. where no one has laid out previous
tracks, there has to be around 1&1/2' -  2' total...
the new snow was very touchy !!  we were cutting under some steep road
cut on a north facing slope and had a sympathetic release that
propagated 70'-80' across. it released above and below the road on the
old bed surface. lots of places that we rode today had some sweet
shooting cracks off to the side...
what the hell, i'll take it. certainly better than being in the

This slope is just outside the Area Boundary for Brighton Resort's Great Western Lift. (we call it the staging area). Ski cuts, including alot of jumping around, had been made on this slope tues 11/22, Weds 11/23 and I also had a report of a collapse in the area today about 10am. Another ski patroller visited the area about 11am on his day off and sent me this report and photos. High wind had been transporting snow over the ridge, stripping the windward slope to the ground. It is possible the witness to the collapse triggered the slide remotely leaving the area and simply did not hear or see it. Or the off duty patrol triggered it skinning the ridge remotely. Or it could have been additioal load from the high winds? I do know however this is a very large slide for the terrain and limited snowpack. Packing a punch when it ran throught the trees and continuing 150ft down slope. Definately enough to mame or kill a person. Like all the others slides of the past week or two the weakness was facets above the Oct crust.

Wow... what a crazy deal this was. Pioneer Ridge was the epicenter of human triggered avalanches this weekend. As I was headed back towards Brighton after looking at yesterday's human triggered avalanche in Martha Bowl, this slide caught the corner of my eye. My partner and I didn't see any exit tracks and we immediately notified Brighton Patrol while constructing a rescue plan. Fortunately, while this was unfolding we were notified that all was OK and the skier was down and clear. This was an extremely close call and I wish the skier a speedy recovery!

Two men in their 30s left the closed Alta ski area with the intent to ride the well known terrain of Alta and Snowbird.  Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries.  We interviewed the victim's ski partner.  To say he was shaken up is an understatement. 

While neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well.  They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High.  They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley.  While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made.  It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche.  They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.

With the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide.  He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried.  The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim. ","","","This incident is difficult for many reasons.  We heard of over 10 human triggered avalanches on the day of the fatality, primarily in the upper elevation terrain in the unopened Alta ski area.  Many of those touring these slopes know the terrain well and are used to riding the terrain when the area is open and the ski patrol has already conducted avalanche control work.  There is always a reinforced feeling of safety. This terrain MUST be treated as if it were the backcountry, proper backcountry protocol must be adhered to (riding one at a time, not skiing on top of others, etc), and personal responsibility is critical (ie - be prepared with avalanche rescue gear, 1st aid equipment, and a repair kit.)

Another word on the incidents (Gunsight at Alta and this Gad Valley one).  The rescue teams from the ski areas and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue often put their necks out on the line to access and evacuate an injured party.  It was reported that other parties at Alta continued to ski and knock down avalanches into Greeley Bowl while the rescue was in progress.  Creating another incident during this situation is unacceptable.

Many of these were triggered remotely and then sympathetic'd other similar soft slabs.","Comment from a witness to the event - 
Same report given earlier but fleshed out a little.  Party of four  approached gunsight as stated in prelim report. One of the party decided  to enter from lower on the ridge rather from the top. Another party of  four joined at the top making seven people at the top and a single skier  down the ridge. While getting ready at the top, the party of seven  witnessed a significant slide enter gunsight from the right where the  lone skier was. After some verbal communication, it was established he  was safe. (Apparently he dropped off the ridge and immediately set off a  slab, although caught briefly, he skied diagonally to a safe spot).  A  few skiers from the party of seven initiated several ski cuts and major  stomping at the top. Evidence of a pre-existing 6-8"" fracture ran along  the left side of the chute for several hundred yards so it appeared as  if the chute had already triggered.  The first skier from the party of  seven descended down the chute and stopped in the trees on the right  side of the chute well below the rope line that demarcates Eddy's High.  Upon stopping, the first skier triggered a small sluff beneath him on  the more westerly aspect of the chute. He watched as the lone skier  approached to his general location and then skied out the chute exiting  to the left towards Greeley Hill. The next skier left from the top and  again skied the main part of the chute and after a brief fall, also  descended the chute past the first skier (who was still in the safe spot  in the trees) and descended out the chute to the left. Third  snowboarder descended the main chute on the left into the debris from  the previous avalanche and again exited at the bottom on the left. At  this point, two skiers and one snowboarder had skied the chute and one  skier had entered the chute from the left (after the avalanche) for a  total of four skiers down below (three below on the left out of the  chute and one in the trees on the right shoulder).  Fourth skier from  the top entered the main chute and skied to the right towards Eddy's  High. Soon after, a slab released above him and catapulted him forward  as it entrained him on its way down the chute. Victim was carried for  600' to 900' (not sure of distance but more than 400'). He was actively  trying to swim and stay towards the top. Near the end of his ride,  victim noticed light off to his left and somehow made his way to the  surface. None of the witnesses could see him after he was initially  swallowed by the avalanche, but as the dust settled he ended up almost  completely out of the snow head up and facing down hill.  The basin  immediately erupted in chaotic yelling as dozens of other people  witnessed the avalanche. The three previous skiers quickly skied down to  him while another went to get help. The three remaining from on top  descended the chute and arrived on scene shortly after. It was quickly  established that victim did not lose consciousness, had strong vital  signs, and chief complaint was severe pain in the left hip. 911 was  called immediately who relayed the info to Alta Central and stayed on  the line with the rescue. While the party as well as several helpful  witnesses worked on stabilizing the victim, another avalanche further  west on Greeley released and ran full track. It was quickly apparent  that more skiers were on the ridgeline and unaware of the rescue  occurring below. A handful of the party remained and moved the victim  out of the slide path to a safe spot above Suzy's tree using the  snowboard as a makeshift sled. Several people from other parties  volunteered their warm gear, puffys, mittens, and even some tea while  party waited for Alta Patrol to evacuate the victim. Approximately 75  minutes later, Alta Patrol picked their way through sketchy conditions  and arrived on scene with a sled. Victim was transferred to the sled in  an upright position and descended to Albion Basin then transported to  the hospital in an ambulance. Victim suffered a fractured femur at the  top of the ball joint.  Kudos to Alta Patrol for not only making it to  the victim under dicey circumstances, but doing so pre-season  short-staffed and in the midst of what turned out to be an all around  highly active day. Many thanks to the other parties who  offered warm gear, support, and pain suppressants.","Other witness - 
Witnessed 3 avalanches in less than 30 minutes. The first was released  by the first of many people to drop into Gunsight Coulior. It ran to the  bottom without carrying the skier. Then several more people dropped in,  sometimes two or three riding at once. About the 5th person to drop in  released a bigger slide that carried him to the bottom. Members of his  party reached him quickly and shouted to call 911. As the injured waited  for help, people continued to drop in and ski down directly above.    Shortly after (while the injured was still waiting for help) a  snowboarded dropped in 50 yards downridge (North) and released a soft  slab that ran over a cliff band and into some small pine trees - luckily  not carrying the rider. A second rider dropped in and rode to the first  rider. Both continued down without any additional incidents.   We did  not travel into the danger area to get better details on the slides, but  the activity we were witnessing seemed downright suicidal.

Propagation connected to a SE facing ridge and set off slide of entire aspect.  I am still hesitant to say it was 100% cornice as everything acted in slab nature, but logic tells me slight cornice formation maybe on top of unstable slope causing slab like nature to cornice area.  Smaller propagation covered the entire face below me.  Had group throw my cornice cutting rope to me as I was surrounded by huge cracks and was afraid to move - tied back in and pulled to safety.

That slide was 9800', NE facing. I didn't go back and it inspect it  as it was so minor. I'd estimate angle to be 35-36 degrees. There were  shooting cracks as I eased onto the slope, I knew it was going to  release in some manor. It was right above some trees which prevented it  from running too far but I believe the slope was a little bit convex  which also helped stop it. It didn't pack any sort of punch, I'd call it  a soft slab (but I'm no expert). The bed surface seemed to be a couple  of inches of the firm October snow. When I looked up at the ""crown"",  there were one or two layers indicating density changes? Don't know. I  usually ski with avalanche professionals so I'm not quite as savvy as I  should be.

On the ground sits 6 to 8 inches of snow from early October which underwent a number of melt freeze cycles but is starting to break down and facet.  In many locations this layer is fairly stout with a melt freeze crust present.
The next layer is from a couple of smaller storms that occurred in mid October.  These layers have become weak through the near surface faceting process over the last few weeks.  I found this layer to be weaker then I expected.  I have only looked at snow one other day so far this winter and the location I looked at had a thinner layer of facets that weren't as loose.
The newest snow sits on top of the facets.  For the most part the new snow is lower density and undisturbed from the wind which doesn't promote ideal slab formation.
BOTTOM LINE:  Conditions are not exceptionally dangerous right now and activity will be quite localized in areas above 9500' on the more northerly aspects.  Keep an eye out on slopes that are still holding snow from October.
How these layers behave in the future is another question.  These layers will no doubt be monitored closely over the next week.  With a ridge of high pressure in the weather forecast (mild weather in other words) I'd expect these layers to undergo more faceting and become at least somewhat weaker.","Of course, I had to go take a look at it because this preexisting faceted snow was exactly what was on my mind and what I intended to look at during the day anyway.  The debris was quite soft.  The pocket was probably just large enough to knock someone over with burial quite unlikely."

Clearly visible from upper elevations on the north side of LCC, this large slide obviously caught our eye. My good friend and Uinta colleague Ted Scroggin made the trip down from Evanston, joining me on my annual Wasatch ski holiday and we took a stroll up Maybird to take a look.","This was an impressive slide and both Ted and I were interested to see if the MLK raincrust was a player. We dug around in several portions of the crown and interestingly enough, were able to identify the crust still quite visible near the bed surface. While no one was present to witness the slide, we suspect the combination of water pooling on the slick crust, combined with the perfect timing of a ginonormous trigger was the culprit behind this unusual avalanche. Of interesting note- a similar event occurred in May 2006 above Cecret Lake.... a large rockfall peeling off Sugarloaf Peak was the trigger in that event. ","This slide was packin' heat, jumping over a well defined stauchwall, running well into low angle terrain.

I thought it strange to see a slab avalanche this time of year and thought it worthy of a post.  Late this April I was attempting to gain the Pfeifferhorn ridge line on this very aspect (from Maybird), while doing so I noticed a change in density in the snow pack, midway up the slope, stopped and dug a pit.  I found 2 layers of graupel about 4-6 inches thick each.  The first starting 6in below the surface and the other about 2' below the surface.  My partner and I decided the graupel made this slope too sketchy and bailed.    I suspect that some rock fall above on the Pfeifferhorn triggered the avalanche shown in the picture and my guess is either the resulting slab avalanche is from the new snow that fell on Sunday June 19th, but I also wonder if it stepped down into this graupel layer that had yet failed to melt and cohere into the snow pack.

I made two mistakes and after thinking about I can look back and learn.  I remember when  skinning up last Friday and I was looking at the big snow crystals on the top of the snow (surface hoar) and made the comment that this could be a weak layer come next storm.  Had powder fever and totally forgot all about that observation when I headed up.  I also made the classic mistake of seeing many tracks and assuming that sincemany people had skied it that its not going to slide.  So me and my partner rode the first pitch, one at a time, with no problems.  Same line we all took off the cornice and down to the flat section last Friday.  Last time I rode that line I went skiers right of that flat section and into the main chute, however me and my partner decided to stay in the trees since that was where the best snow was.  I started the second pitch and about my third turn snow was fracturing all around me.  The fracture shot out about 15 ft to my left and about 50 feet to my right.  I carved a hard left and was eventually able to get out to the side of it.  I shouted out ""AVALANCHE"" for my partner and put the avalung in my mouth as I made the desperate carve to the left.  Another thing that kinda freaked me out was the slide started in the glade within the trees and spread out to some thick tree sections of the bowl. Slab was about 75-100 feet wide and about 14 inches thick and ran for a hundred yards.  I always kinda assume that trees were a safer choice, not last night.  My theory is that the sun was out all day and got kinda warm.  Even though those trees did not see any direct sun it got warm enough to consolidate that new snow layer into a thick slab.  The cold nights really built up some surface hoar in those sheltered tree zones making a weak layer that was not found in the main chute.  The main avalanche chute had enough daytime sun to keep those weak crystals building up actually making the gut a safer choice.  Lesson learned.","","",""

Aside from the two distinct crowns, the rest of the slide was only about 6 inches deep. We could see from the top that it had gone a long ways, but after skiing down, it was apparent that it went nearly the entire length of the slope, roughly 1500' vertical. The weakness appeared isolated to the top of Kessler, which makes complete sense considering the ferocious winds the day before, as we didn't notice any similar issues on our ski down in the more protected terrain. Close call, but fortunate that it was only a ski pole that was lost.","","",""

We then traversed east to the Black Knob with the intention of skiing north aspects into Cardiff, and exiting Pole Line.    As we skinned east (not booting west, as Bruce wrote), we stayed on the north aspect of the ridge.   As we approached our descent location for the north aspect of The Black Knob, one of use peered over the south face.  There was literally no more than 6"" of ski on the ridge crest when the slide broke out directly from the top of the crest.  There was no cornice in this area.  We had no intention of being on the south face this day, especially at noon after watching other skier triggered slides two hours prior.

The fracture line went all along the southern boarder of the face starting at around 10400', up to about 11200', across the bowl and to the northern edge (we could not see the northern edge of the crown therefore total width estimate is difficult, perhaps about 1/4 - 1/3 mile?). Depth appeared to vary but the crown looked to be about 1 foot for most of it. The debris appeared to have stopped mostly at the bench around 9700', but it looked like some debris ran into the gully far below. We decided to cut a cornice to see what affect it would have on the slope. With people C and D spotting, A and B approached the chosen cornice. Right where/when spotter C said to 'stop' the cornice released between A and B's feet. Luckily both stepped back onto the ridge. The cornice was about 20 feet wide, perhaps 10 feet out. It triggered another 200+ foot wide avalanche on the east face of Mt Nebo (it was very hard to see just how far the new crown propagated due to our extreme hesitation to get too close to the edge). This slide was above the fracture already observed and was thought to be the same new snow/old snow layer. It looked to be about the same thickness and ran to the obvious bench at about 9700'. At this time our party decided to retreat.  Another Note/Observation A natural cornice fall had occurred sometime the night before in the NW couloir. This cornice fall then triggered a slide which propagated all the way down the chute to the apron. From afar we were not sure what exactly had happened but as we gained elevation we could see the point where the cornice had fallen from above a large cliff and landed in the couloir. As we got even closer we could see sympathetic crowns/fractures all the way down the chute on the looker's right side and we began to really understand and appreciate how huge the resulting debris pile in the apron was.","","",""

There were 3 tracks into West Bowl, 2 of which were from the summit and one from lower down on the shoulder to the east. We hadn't seen any instabilities and knew the winds had been blowing per the avie report and what we saw as the sun came up while on top of Silver Fork/Honeycomb Ridge.   While skinning up into West Bowl I was breaking trail and pulled over to let another lead out, noticing that there was a graupel layer about 4-5"" down. When rejoining the skin track there were small pieces of slab that slid on this graupel layer onto the skin track below me which I should have kept in mind later in our tour. Mistake #1.   As we neared the top of West Bowl, one of our party suggested holding up as the other two went to the top and he would take some photos as we descended into west bowl with Alta in the background. As we skinned up to the top I thought it best to descent skiers left of the existing tracks, but then focusing more on the photos decided to ski to the skiers right of the summit along the ridgeline and then drop in allowing for a better photo. Mistake #2.  I pushed off and made a couple of turns along the ridge gaining some speed and made my third turn to the right along the ridge/cornice edge which was more rounded in this spot. Exiting this turn and making the next turn to my left into the main part of the bowl I looked out ahead and saw what in a split second looked like a skin track but then clearly looked like a large ripple. I then realized the snow around me was rippling up and looking over my shoulder saw I was in the middle of a slide that had broken at the top of ridge where my third turn was. Fortunately I was carrying enough speed to maintain a trajectory across the slide and exit to the skiers left as the slab and other snow was carried another 200' down slope clipping the edge of the pines in West Bowl.  Luckily for me the slide was only 60' wide and at most 12"" deep which likely wouldn't have completely buried me given it didn't entrain more snow but I easily could have been knocked down and strained through the pines.

I witnessed one very poor decision in Toledo Chute on Monday. Standing on Flagstaff at 1pm, I watched a skier make two turns in Toledo and initiate a sluff. He stopped and the whole chute ran out, slowly at first, but gaining momentum and entraining a lot of wet snow. He continued to ski the edge of his sluff path, and his partner (snowboarder) simultaneously dropped in skier's right, along the edge of the ridge. The snowboarder triggered a similar sluff, turned a bit farther right (south), triggered more, then cut left under his original sluff. Thus, everything skier's right of the main chute was sluffing, as he casually made turns down the edge of the ridge. The sluff gained speed and chased him down the face, gaining quickly. I (from over 2000' away) could hear the sound of the wet snow rushing down the hill. The skier heard it too, looked back, and yelled at the snowboarder (I could hear him yell). The boarder looked up, veered hard left, and escaped with about 1.5-2 seconds remaining before the sluff would have caught him. The snow proceeded down the face and through the small trees in the runout, bending them towards the ground upon impact. After it settled I could hear the two conversing at the base of the pitch, saying something along the lines of 'that would have been a bad day,' and chuckling too. It probably wouldn't have been a fatal carry, as the debris pile was not very deep, but it would have been very uncomfortable to be dragged through the small trees at the bottom.  I felt that we were quite late in exiting Day's Fork (1pm), skiing back to LCC road down South facing Flagstaff. The snow was warm, wet and sticky. There was less activity on the gentler Flagstaff pitch, but it was still not a good time to be on the South aspect. I also noticed heavy wet sluffing on steep SE Superior. The steep SE Toledo should not have been skied at that time. It was a poor choice.  You can see the path and debris from the Alta side. I didn't estimate all of the dimensions, but it would be easy to do so on a topo. It was quite interesting to watch it all happen. A good reminder to make smart choices.

I had some reluctance about skiing in this area, and about this slope, but skied it anyway. I was feeling a bit of (unstated, and possibly imagined) group pressure. A cornice was easily available to drop on the slope, but I did not avail of this test, nor did I make a slope cut. It was all my own doing. Clues to instability were all around me: a foot of new snow, wind loading, spontaneous sluffing, and new snow sliding on crust.  The new snow sluffed just below the ridgeline, leaving a (estimated size) 12-14 inch crown. The sluff knocked me down, carried me a short distance, and I was not buried. The underlying firm layer allowed me to dig my skis and poles in, and I hung on, while the sluff passed me. The pressure I felt from  this small slide was impressive; much more and I would not have been able to hold on.  No injuries, other than to my pride and faith in my judgement.

For most of the morning temps were nice and cold and the new snow stayed light and powdery and everything seemed very stable.  As the day wore on and the temps and sun rose, the snow started to get more damp and stick to my skins so we figured it was time to leave.  We headed back to the car by taking a relatively direct route from the top of Reynolds down the South face back to the Mill D parking lot.  The conditions on that aspect were about 5 inches of new snow on top of a solid and slick sun crust.    As my wife descended first she initiated a small point release behind her which looked like minor sloughing of the new snow on top of the sun crust.  It moved pretty slowly (never more than 10-15 mph max) but started to get wider and pick up more and more snow.  It eventually caught up to her when she stopped and carried her for about 50 feet until she grabbed a small tree and it continued (still slowly) another couple hundred feet.  The whole thing probably lasted more than a minute and carved all the new snow off the slope down to the sun crust.  It never moved quickly or violently and didn't seem like it would have buried anybody but it would not have been pleasant had it pulled anyone over a cliff or other hazard.  In retrospect we underestimated how fast the sun and rapidly warming temperatures were changing the snow conditions.  We also could have chosen any number of less direct return routes to the car that would not have been nearly as susceptible to this type of activity which was clearly predicted in the morning avalanche advisory.  It is interesting to note that the underlying crust was so slick it seemed that the wet snow continued sliding on slope angles that were substantially less than 30 degrees.","","",""

The slide continued down for several hundred more feet and stopped above the lower choke.    At that point we quickly turned around, so I don't know where the slide started and how long it ran in total.  There was some wind blowing snow around in the rocks and trees near Perla Peak, so we theorize that some snow dropping from a tree may have triggered a small sluff in the rocks, which then was lucky enough to find more new snow to entrain.

Heading south on highway 89, just before you get to Fairview, UT, you get a glimpse of the Mountains of the Manti Skyline.  One of the most striking features is the Horseshoe bowl with its steep north facing tree chutes.  7 Skiers from Utah were captivated by that bowl some time ago.  After spending time planning & thinking about the captivating shot, they set out to ski it on March 26th, 2011.
These are expert skiers; most of the party has been skiing since childhood.  Backcountry experience amongst the members of the group ranges from 2 – 14 years.  Each member of the group was carrying beacon, shovel & probe, and they had all practiced with their gear.  Most members of the group had taken a Level 1 recreation avalanche course.  A few members of the group had read the current avalanche forecast in its entirety which rated the overall hazard as Moderate with pockets of Considerable with “the possibility for deep slab avalanches on steep rocky upper elevation slopes facing the north half of the compass.”  
The group left the Ephraim Canyon trailhead in the morning in a modern snowcat, reaching the Horseshoe Bowls after a couple hours of travel.  Visibility was good, although it was windy, and they noticed a storm brewing to the west on the Nebo side of the valley.
The group observed that the Little Shoe Bowl was actively wind loading, so they moved over to the Big Shoe Bowl.  Once there, they put one person on belay.  That person, now tied in, went out to the massive cornice and started cutting and kicking pieces of cornice onto the slope to test for stability.  These cornice drops produced very small loose snow avalanches aka sluffs.  The group thought these sluffs were a manageable avalanche hazard & decided to send a two members into the slope to conduct more snow stability testing.  A & B got into the upper part of the slope and dug down 6’ or so.  They then conducted a few compression tests which resulted in sudden planer shears 16” in depth.   All members of the group commented how they didn’t like the results.  A & B then moved a few feet to a different location to conduct a few more tests.  The results were similar, and the group came to the consensus that they didn’t want to ski this slope.  They began gathering their gear to leave the area.
At that point C & D were standing near the edge of the cornice which suddenly gave way. C fell with the VW Bus sized piece of cornice that broke off and triggered the large avalanche.  C was carried almost all the way down the avalanche path.  Viewing from above, D saw C get up and start moving around and for a moment the group thought they had dodged a bullet.  They soon realized that A & B had also been caught and carried by the avalanche.  D instructed E, F & G who were waiting in the snowcat to call 911 which they did as there is cell service at this location.  This call was placed around 11:45am & EMS was mobilized.
D then switched his beacon to receive and went down the slope to start the rescue of A & B.  As D arrived at the debris pile he found C searching, and C & D got to B who was buried, but had his head & one arm free.  They cleared B’s mouth, and then E arrived on the scene and dug B the rest of the way out.  
Leaving E to continue digging, C & D searched for A’s beacon signal which they quickly acquired.  Using their beacons, they followed the flux lines to A’s location and found a ski boot heel on the snow surface.  A was almost completely buried, and appeared to have suffered serious trauma during the avalanche.   The group worked in shifts to quickly & efficiently dig A out.  Once out of the snow,  A had no vital signs; he was blue in the face, not breathing and had no pulse.  Heroically, the group began the exhausting work of administering CPR.  They did so for a full hour.  Just as they contemplated stopping, A’s chest rose on its own and a pulse was detected, although he did not regain consciousness.  The group administered rescue breaths for the next two hours while keeping A as warm as possible.  The group was utterly exhausted at this point, now waiting for SAR teams to reach them to help get them & their critically injured friend up and out of the steep bowl.  
The party estimates they got to B in 8 minutes & had A dug out 15 minutes after the avalanche was triggered which is nothing short of amazing given the circumstances & the size of the avalanche.
At this point SAR teams composed of over 75 volunteers from both Sanpete & Sevier Co. were battling absolutely epic conditions to get to the party waiting in this very remote location.  A storm had rolled in and reduced the visibility to just a few feet, further complicating the situation.  Eventually, SAR teams were able to deploy over 2100’ of rope to get down to the party.  SAR teams brought food, water, started a fire to warm the group and began the long & arduous process of getting the skiers back to the top of the bowl, a distance of over 1000’ vertical feet.
In an amazing show of strength and determination, all rescuers and victims were back on top of the ridge near nightfall.  By 9:30pm all rescuers and victims were in vehicles heading back towards the highway.
Forecasters Comments.
Once the avalanche occurred, the party preformed a text book rescue, and really did everything right.  Amazingly, they pulled their friend out of the snowpack dead, and brought him back to life.  This is an outstanding effort on their part.
This accident really comes down to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  While the party was trying to do the right thing by gathering information, they were doing so in the start zone of a major avalanche path, an incredibly hazardous area & high risk activity.  Unfortunately, the backcountry snowpack can be a very harsh and unforgiving judge, and the party paid the ultimate price for this mistake in the loss of a loved one.  I am deeply saddened by this accident and my thoughts & prayers are with the party this evening.
SAR teams were tasked with an incredibly difficult mission in downright nasty conditions.  The volunteers who boldly went out into the storm to help the victims truly embody what it is to be a hero.  Had the party been forced to endure the cold stormy night out in the elements, the outcome could have been very different.   Sanpete & Sevier Co. SAR, my hat is off to you.  Well done.","","","Skis are visible still sticking out of the crown in the upper left corner.","","",""

We rode in the Prov Canyon/Logan Peak area. The winds were raging along the ridge tops, hard enough to knock us off our feet several times. By about 1:00 PM it turned to full on winter with blizzard like conditions. Anything but the most protected areas were heavily wind affected from last night and today’s winds. In the more protected areas the riding was a nice consolidate powder (North and East). It felt like the rain line was around the 8000-8300 foot elevation. Anything above that elevation we found surprisingly good snow.
Pit tests on a North facing, 40 degree slope at around 8800 feet  showed somewhat stable conditions. We got consistent failures down about 10-12 inches on the 12-14 tap (2-4 from elbow). Extended column test on this same layer did NOT propagate so we felt pretty good about the snowpack in that area. The rest of the snowpack down to the MLK crust was consolidated and stable.  I cut loose one very small slab (10ft X 6ft X 10in) on a heavily loaded area around 9100 feet. Other than that, many slope cuts on steep terrain did not release any slabs.  
As we traveled into the Providence lake area we noticed a very wide slab on triple terrace (East facing 9200 ft). The slab was most likely 500 feet wide and 1-2 feet deep. The slide extends beyond the edges of the picture below. Due to the winds and heavy snow at the time we could not tell what triggered the slide or how far it ran. That is the only evidence of any recent slides we saw in the area.","","",""

In looking at the picture below, you can see where he skied from right to left in intentionally release the slab and duck in there beneath he cliffband.  Of course this type of thing is commonplace for a ski patroller of 15 years - or other snow professionals under these circumstances.  We knew the avalanche we were dealing with - and it was not a hard slab, deep slab or dealing with a persistent grain type.   
 
 
Of great interest, however, was the loud whoomph at the bottom of the slope.  After the avalanche had run its course 700'  to the flats, the fourth skier down to the debris triggered a very loud, widely propagating Deep Slab collapse.  Probing had the rain crust buried there 6-9' deep.
 
Tilt and compression tests indicate density breaks about a foot down, but anticipate a quick heal with these temps.
Greenhousing and temps had dampened north facing snow up to and over 9000' on north facing.

While breaking  trail up, on a steep East facing slope I let the group know to watch out for push alanches. On the up track the green housing was in full effect making the snow surface damp and very heavy. For our first run I was weary of the snow and made sure everyone knew to look out for these sluffs.
I dropped in and made it down about 1/4 of the run and pulled out on some high ground. And not to my suprise I watched the snow start as a small sluff and just get bigger from there. All of our party came to me and I decided to ride down another 1/4 of the hill. Again I made a big sweeping turn to high ground with some trees. While I was waiting for the rest of the group to come down to me, I looked up hill and noticed a four to five foot wall of snow coming right for me. I pointed the board down hill but it was to late it hit me with a lot of power and took me into a stand of thick trees where I got caught, while the main mass washed through.
This avalanche started at my feet, but by the time it was done it was 400-600 feet wide and the debris pile was 10 feet deep in places.
All in all no injuries I did get my pants ripped open though.
This is my ninth season in the backcountry and my first time being in any avalanche. I would advise that everyones goal is to never be caught in one.

It appeared that the initial trigger was a wind slab that ran naturally at the top of the crown where it was much thinner, and subsequently stepped down into the January snow.  Fairly complex pattern...as the bed surface 30m below the crown was the rain crust, then it then stepped to near the ground.  
Unable to replicate any failures on the weaknesses with any classic 'tests' so to speak; however, I was able to crowbar out an extended column by prying on the back to initiate a full propagation at the same weakness.  "

We also noted what looked to be a large but relatively shallow slab crown on the steep east face of one of the peaks at the head of Rolfson Canyon, but the evening sun shadowed the face and made observation and photography difficult.  Mixed messages from the Skyline then--a large natural slide on a steep east-facing slope WITHOUT any apparent cornice break, and several large cornice breaks that didn't seem to produce any slab activity on similar slopes and aspects.

We spent a good amount of time checking out the fracture line. Investigation revealed a 1m to 1.5m slab sitting atop the MLK rain crust. This is an area where the MLK crust was on the surface until last week. There was 40cm new snow F hardness sitting on 20cm of 4F snow, this all on a 50cm pencil hard windslab, with the dust layer evident at the base. Right below the dust layer was the friable 0.5cm MLK crust (what was left of it), and below were 4mm striated cups, F hardness to the ground for about 70cm. CT scores varied widely from failure upon isolation to CT30, depending on the depth of the pencil hard slab. The consistent part of the test was the shear character, a Sudden Collapse.

Kobernik
This was a significant avalanche.  Mr Miller's assessment was correct in my opinion.  It was a recent windload which failed just above the January rain crust.  There was no significant weakness directly above the crust.  It was difficult to get this weakness to fail in shear tests.  The rapid addition of weight from the wind transported snow seemed to be the biggest factor.  I suspect that if this slope were left alone for another 24 hours to give the fresh wind load a little more time to settle it probably wouldn't have avalanched.
I tip my hat to these guys for checking out the crown and trying to figure out what was going on with the layering.  Our sled community is becoming more savvy as the years go on and it's great to see!!"

The new snow felt dense & punchy, so we decided to throw a ski cut into the slope before proceeding.  Adam executed a nice ski cut but wasn't going quite fast enough.  He slid down the bed surface a few feet before successfully arresting.  The slide was fairly fast moving as it moved down the gulley.  The failure occurred on NSF snow created by cold temps earlier this week.

Looks like most of the activity involving the Jan. 8th surface hoar (SH) has been on mid & high elevation slopes facing N, NE & E.  The SH has certainly come alive in the last week & we've heard of numerous human triggered avalanches failing in a variety of forms.  SH is notoriously tricky, and the layer continues to earn it's reputation.  Avalanches have been failing mid slope & many of the slides have been on pretty low angle terrain too.
Looking around the Uintas today, the surface hoar is preserved almost  everywhere.  The determining factor seams to be the crust and it's  varied strength. Unfortunately, I have a feeling this layer will continue to catch people off gaurd this weekend.  Once we really start adding a load to it (in the form of significant water/storm snow), things will get very interesting.","","",""

Yesterday (Sunday, Jan 16) we narrowly escaped being swallowed by a  massive avalanche at the base of Squash Head in Santaquin Canyon.  It  was by far the biggest avalanche I’ve ever seen in my life, and we were  lucky to escape with our lives.  My partner was knocked down and  partially buried, but managed to scramble out of the impact zone before  being completely engulfed.  I was directly in the impact zone when the  slide was spotted coming from above, but had just enough time to run to  the base of Martini and hide under the roof.  The slide persisted for  1-2 minutes, and buried the base of the route to the road in at least 8  feet of dense snow (maybe more in places).   
We lost quite a bit of  gear, either from it being buried or from trying to flee the scene as  quickly as possible (for fear of another slide).  A blast of air  preceding the slide blew most of our gear down slope and kept it from  being buried, but we lost a few items: 

•Pair of one of a kind, custom made ice tools.  They’re I-beam in construction and silver colored aluminum with black handles. 
•Stuff sack full of gloves and clothing 
•Couple of ice screws 
•10  quick draws on the mixed route, Martini.  We didn’t want to hang around  and retrieve the draws – please leave them fixed until we can get back  and pull them down 

This gear is going to melt out eventually – if you come across any of it please send me a PM.

The rumbling from above made me turn back uphill. I looked up and saw that something quite large had released above us to the climbers right and was now emptying into the couloir directly above us.

From the parking lot afterward, there is a small, but obvious, path kinda fall line below the      Y-not that looked to be the guilty party. A roller ball off a rock could have started the whole thing. While still in the parking lot, I witnessed two other naturals in the same zone.    In hindsight, we placed too much faith in the aspect to keep temps cool. We bailed when the signs were big, flashing and neon, but we should have gone else where. I made a mistake and got lucky.

Narrative as emailed by one of the party members:
        We left from Alta and hiked to pole line pass.  After skiing down into mill D south drainage we agreed and noticed that there we some wind loading and cracking near the ridge line and adjusted our plans to stay in more gentle terrain.  We climbing the small dividing ridge that I do not know the name of.   Near the top of this ridge we noticed a very small release about 100 feet away in the new snow about 4 inches deep.  It seemed like a natural release but may have beet remotely trigged.  
We skied the open trees toward the Cardiff Mine.  From here we still agreed to make it towards our car parked at the base of mineral fork while staying away from higher entrances we chose to make the pass below high ivory.  Following more the more benign terrain we found ourselves in the catch of getting to high too soon and then either having to ski down or climb the slight bench below ivory flakes.  The desire for us not to descend on the climb got us into this area with a dangerous climb to the ridge.  At this point we continued more or less spread out but all exposed to the bowl above.  
As I was crossing what seemed to be the most exposed section, no longer in the run out but in an obvious gully mid slide path.  It was approximately 11:50 am. I felt some collapsing and looking up a small slide descended on me washing past my waist and leaving me mid thigh in light snow that I was able to kick turn out of.  When I turned around to check on the rest of my party I saw the large powder cloud descending behind the closest two members of my party.  It seemed like the smaller slide I was in triggered the remainder of the bowl.  The two members behind me were only slightly affected and the slide washed past them enveloping their legs.  The three of us who were not carried or buried skied down two the two who were carried both about 100 feet and partially buried.  They were about 2 feet apart and one had all but an arm buried and the other had all but a head and an arm buried.  They were general on top of the snow and the debris was soft as we removed their skis (Both Dynafit in hiking mode and none releases in the slide) and removed them with some hand digging.  Both of them complained of lower leg injuries one of soreness in both knees and the other of pain in the ankles especially the right one. They both decided to try skiing out. Everyone was ready to descend and 12:05 with all gear recovered.  Only two poles needed some searching for.  We were able to get everyone out skiing on their own power or assisted to ski down to Big Cottonwood Canyon road by 2:05pm .    ","","","","","","Photo is from a previous time but jus to show the location.  The big yellow dot is where I was and likely trigged the avalanche.  The other red dots are the other members of my party when the slide occurred.  The red lines are for those who were carried and purple dots are where they were found partially buried.  The blue line is the approximate slide area.  There was no obvious crown line and the upper boundary of the slide is mostly guesswork.  The larges deposition was between skiers 2 and 3 from the bottom and was probably 1.5 to 2 meters deep.

I choked on a big piece of humble pie today after 20 years of a fairly safe track record of ski touring.  Skinnd up Pole Line, with the idea of looking at south aspects. We decided to take a look at Little Sup or Sup, realizing the wind had been blowing and seeing that on both aspects.  We figured we'd take a poke and a look around.  As we traversed ahead, some spots had wind loading off the ridges, other places just had nice soft snow, unaffected by wind transport.  We got to the base of Little Sup and crossed a couple small, isolated wind slabs.  We found ourselves further out from the ridge than we liked, and then discussed cutting back to the ridge and booting up the rocks.  We thought we were on consolidated snow, or a bed surface, or really shallow snow with minimal hazard.  Admittedly, I did not probe into the snowpack where we were.  We spread out as best we could and started to go back to the rocky ridge.  As the first in our party cut back, the slope broke around him and he nonchalantly said ""avalanche"".  The second in our group was on a sub-ridge and was out of harms way.  I was just about to the sub-ridge, but not quite.  I saw the slide coming and hustled on my skins, but no dice............  Here's a photo looking up at the crown.  It propagated from the first in our group up about 15ft, culminating in a crown with a max depth of about 3ft, but mostly in the 1-3ft range.  It also seemed to propagate left and right, pulling more down from the initial fracture.  The right half of the crown line in the photo below.   I got hit and at first thought It was small and might be able to self arrest on the bed surface, but I looked up and it seemed to be just getting bigger.  I got knocked face first, through my poles away and tried to twist out of my skis because they were clearly pulling me down.   I failed to get my avalung in my mouth because I was clawing at the bed surface trying to not get swept over the cliffs and rocks below.  Eventually the slide went over and around me and I was able to stop somehow, not sure how.  My poles were gone, skis were off, legs and waist buried, face and head down hill.    I could see one of our party was fine, but I yelled out for the other and heard nothing.  I extricated myself and yelled again, then heard the other in our party.  He was perhaps 200+ feet below, unburied, skis on, self arrested on the bed surface before the cliffs, he was able to get his avalung in his mouth right away.  Aftermath, the first in our party skinning back up the bed surface.This photo shows the width of the slide, with the two skiers on the left and right borders.   This photo is deceptive.  The crown is at the upper right hand corner, the rest of what appears to be a crown is not.  It's shallow snow that lured us out there in the first place, but we didn't pay enough attention to the fact that it deepened and was all loaded up like a trap.   I call this the ""RETARDS"" photo.  Look at what those retards skinned into, no wonder they got rolled.  The snow leading into it was not wind loaded or slabby at all, but it changed quickly.  Unfortunately we decided to turn around 10ft too late and got a lesson from old Mother Nature. Another retrospective photo.  Again, the crown is not what it looks like.  If you look at the slide patch, that will give you an idea of the crown width.  The right border of the slide path was where we first discussed cutting back to the ridge, as that was where we first encountered the wind slab.  Again, hindsight is 20/20, should have turned back right then, and not continued on that last 10-15ft before making a kick turn.   The reset button has been pushed, we all got humbled.  And although I usually consider myself conservative and willing to back off, today the decision to back off just happened about 15ft or 30 seconds too late, even though we all recognized the danger but didn't respect it enough.  The consequences for going for a ride here are very high, and we were obviously very lucky.  The turns out to the road were refreshing. ","","",""

I intentionally triggered a soft slab in the very southernmost part of Toledo Bowl, from the peak in the chute that runs about 1000 vertical in a due east direction.

I knew know one was there as I had put in the skin track to the peak.  I knew this chute was going to move but I was quite surprised how fast and how far it went.  I generally try not to be surprised in the backcountry, and I am mad when I get surprised.  I think this chute was far more windloaded and denser than I would have guessed from my previous runs in main and banana days on similar aspects.  I did have a very small soft slab release at the bottom of main days on a very steep (>45 degrees) aspect, but it was totally manageable and expected.  I think this slide surprised me because of how predictable things had been over in days fork.  I forgot my camera so there are no pics.  (first trip of the season, I was lucky I remembered the beacon).  It did pull out parts of the chute that were not directly in the slide path in a sort of sympathetic fashion.

While ascending the ridge of Rocky Points from Katherine's Pass I triggered three avalanches in the first three chutes. These were triggered by very small cornice drops, walking slope cuts, and gentle stomping on the ridgeline. The snow was very sensitive. Propagation was quick and widespread in this area. The snow that was active was all areas that received loading from the NW winds but had not gotten thick with wind loading. The slabs were all soft slabs and the deepest crown face was 11 inches with the majority of crown faces around 8 inches. In the Second Chute after the slide filtered through a narrow choke it fanned out to 60 feet wide with propagation. All slides were in the new snow only. Widespread cracking was occurring in all starting zones with slopes < 35 degrees not moving more than 5 mm stress cracks. All slides were initiating on slope angles 37 degrees and greater. Slides were not making it to the flats with the deepest debris piles 2 to 3 feet deep. Obviously they most likely wouldn't bury you, but they could ruin your day and push you into a place where you didn't want to go. These slides occurred at 10:00 am. Weak layer was the old snow interface, and there appeared to be light density layer directly above the old snow surface. The aspects ranged from ENE to SE.
On the exit at 3:00 pm I was able to trigger the steep chute on rider's right of the main chute in the Dog Lake Chutes area. This slide was a pocket that was a foot deep and ran to the flat transition. Soft slab again. It started out 20 feet wide and propagated to 60 feet wide as it rolled over the steep section 70 feet down hill. The aspect was NNE. After triggering this Chute I traversed to the Main Chute. In the main Chute I triggered a sluff that was 20 feet wide and taking almost all the new snow. This also ran to the transition. All weak layers were the same as in the Rocky Points area. The slope angles were at least 37 degrees.
After riding on the Dog Leg Chute in the Rocky Points area I went to Point Supreme and skied the North aspect and as well as the South aspect. At this point in time the Supreme area has not opened for the season yet.  In steep areas with wind loading (and firm/hard slab loading) I was not experiencing anything more than limited cracking without any movement. The best riding was on the lower half of the Helicopter Shot on Point Supreme. All of the slopes besides the Dog Leg Chute in the Katherine's area were wind damaged with either cross wind destruction or up slope wind waves. Sunset was destroyed. 
New snow in Brighton was 8 inches. New snow in the Katherines area and on Point Supreme was closer to 10 inches. 
The hazard appeared to be Moderate in areas of wind loading. The hazard on Tuesday may be Considerable with increasing temperatures and solar triggering. ","","",""

One rider apparently decided to at least partially ascend ""Cherry Hill"" a popular snowmobile play slope in the drainage north of Superbowl. The other rider, playing on low angle terrain adjacent to Dennis, did not see him ascend but saw the dust cloud of the avalanche and there was a lone snowmobile track halfway up the bowl.  

He assumed his friend was buried and did a quick search of the debris and did not find any surface clues.  Since he had no beacon or shovel, he rode to a high point where he could call for a rescue and went back on the debris to continue searching.  He eventually located the tip of a snowmobile ski sticking out of the snow, possibly with other riders in the area.  Someome had an avalanche probe and they located the victim just uphill of his snowmobile.  He was buried about 2 feet deep and he did not respond to recessitation. 
An air ambulance arrived with an Alta ski patroller and his rescue dog but apparently the victim was found by the victim's partner and others in the area.
Total burial time is unknown, but believed to be over a half hour.

The avalanche was likely triggered by the weight of the snowmobile and its rider at mid slope. The avalanche broke up to near the ridge and was quite large 3-5 feet fracture crown and 600 feet wide and it descended to the bottom of the bowl.  ","","","","","",""

 I began dropping cornices in the 99 Steps Chute area. I dropped at least 7 chunks descending the ridgeline to the North. Cornices were sensitive and very hard/firm. They were in the size of a small car for the most part. After the 7th chunk I released a small mini-van size chunk about 250 to 300 feet down the ridgeline from the 99 Steps Chute; and it struck the slope and triggered the slide. It propagated back up to the 99 Steps Chute and also propagated down the ridge at lease another 400 feet. The largest crown face area appeared to be at least 6 feet and most likely closer to 7 feet. It was difficult to get a good close look at the triggering point. Graupel pooling and extreme wind loading appeared to play a large part in the slab development. The slide occurred 130 feet down off the ridge where a cliff/rock face rolls over for steepness. The slide went to the ground at the top of all the starting zones. The aspect at the trigger point was ENE. Upon descending the ridgeline to the North, when the bowl loses steepness before the pass, I entered the East side of the bowl and experienced collapsing and propagating on 23 degree slopes. The aspect in this area is ESE.
 
Weather during the day was a combination of intermittent snow, gusty winds and partially clearing skies. New snow during the day was 2 to 3 inches. Winds were out of the SSW. Transport was heavy at times of the stronger winds. Loading was occurring well down the slopes. Propagation previously mentioned on the 23 degree slopes also was shearing in facets directly above the ground and on these ESE aspects there was not a m/f crust 5 inches above the ground. Cracking occurred with minimal slope movement. The stress crack was 3 mm wide. No other signs of instability were observed. This kind of deep slab instability appears to be isolated to upper elevation wind loaded areas on NW, N, NE, E, and SE aspects. The pattern appears to indicate that slides are breaking well down off the ridgelines and below the normal steep starting zones.

Pine canyon: 300-400 foot crown on a Northeast  facing slope.  It appeared to involve the new snow only.  The slide started near the ridge (wind affected area) and ran approximately 500 feet ,
 
South Shumway Canyon: 200 foot crown at mid slope (approximately 8000 feet) on a North facing slope.  This was an interesting slides because it did not appear to have propagated from a  wind affected area.  The slide ran several hundred feet down the canyon.
 
Shumway Canyon: 200-300 foot crown starting at the  highest peak on the Northeast facing slope.  The slide ran around 1000 feet.  This area has slide at least three times this year that I have noticed. 
 
Coldwater Canyon:  Minor slabs released on  Northeast facing slopes.
 
North fork Hells Canyon:  Small slab running  1500-200 vertical.
 
Old Logway: This was the most significant slab that  I could see.  If you look in Jason Wooden’s picture you can see the crown running approximately 1500 feet down the south ridge.  There were also several small slabs that sympathetically released further down the  canyon in less wind affected areas. 
 
Mendon Peak:  Looked like a small slab released  during the storm and was mostly covered later in the storm.
 
OVERALL:  I observed many slab avalanches releasing  on steep (>35 degrees) North to East facing slopes.  Most avalanches appeared  to involve only the new snow and most were in wind affected areas.  There were several other smaller avalanches in non-wind affected areas the  released sympathetically.  Agree with the assessment of a High avalanche danger.

 Then as we were heading across Cardiff towards Mineral on an East  facing slope we found a pocket that had pulled out from a previous ski  cut.  Looked like it went on a ski cut up to 18"" deep. East facing and  likely loaded up with the same winds as the Days slide. As I approached  the crown I got a loud collapse and shooting crack, so there's a lot of  energy stored in some of these pockets that could really ruin your day.  Skied out Westerly facing Mineral fork without incident. Snow was heavy  but stable and skied well.

Here's my Bottom Line for Saturday Morning, (3-27-10)
There is MODERATE (2) danger at upper and mid elevations in the backcountry. You could trigger wind slab avalanches 1 to 2 feet deep in exposed terrain, especially near ridge-tops and in and around terrain features like cliff bands, sub ridges, and gullies. Solar heating could rapidly cause a heightened danger of loose wet avalanches entraining significant moist fresh snow on steep slopes exposed to prolonged direct sun. I’ve included pockets of CONSIDERABLE  (3) danger in today’s rose since triggered avalanches are probable in some areas, although they should be fairly predictable and mostly manageable.
Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully and continue to follow safe  travel protocols...","","""Yeah it was a little nerve racking.. mainly because the rider was on a  powdersurf board without bindings...""

skibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's  cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great  snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left  those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a  great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine  with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team  and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially  after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very  top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing  sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it  had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the  last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really  something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three.  made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling  something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to  stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and  around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot  range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i  think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it,  my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large  trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my  legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both  skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my  shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on  in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the  final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it  was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the  debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with  the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my  partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was  by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and  maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very  easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or  ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was  stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to  afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right  place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else  was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full  account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to  completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight  tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a  sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day,  though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel  comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am  surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were  getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was  apparently injured or worse.","","","","","",""

Logan Canyon has been re-opened to traffic after three minor snow slides shut U.S. Highway 89 down for about 90 minutes Friday afternoon.

The slides happened around 5 p.m. One-lane of traffic re-opened just before 6:30 p.m. as crews worked to remove the rest of the snow that covered the upper portion of the dugway. After 7, both lanes were re-opened to traffic.

Two of the slides happened before 5 p.m., but a third slide came down while crews were in the process of clearing the snow.

There were no injuries as a result of the slides.

Not able to travel through the canyon included hundreds of patrons at Beaver Mountain trying to return home after a day skiing, but also at the mountain were the fifth grade classes at Wilson Elementary School.

Mark Lunt, a parent of a student at Wilson, said he was at the Wilson Elementary parking lot Friday night waiting for his child when he heard about the slides.

""The parking lot is full with probably like 45 cars waiting for kids to get down the canyon,"" Lunt said. 

Reports from Beaver Mountain indicated that many people who were stranded at the top of the canyon decided to return to the ski resort and continue skiing. The cafe area at the Beaver Mountain Ski Lodge reportedly also remained open to cater to those who couldn't get home.

Below is video from Blake Altom of the aftermath:

had slid naturally creating a crown line that extended across the gully  up
on the western rocky side and then went extended all the way down the  side

substantial debris at the bottom - each gully is slightly more than 30
degrees and pretty much true north facing.

The eastern most of the three is the shallowest and least steep - 30  degrees

hazard was considerable (just as your report indicated). I had skied the
center gully on Tuesday , the day before the most recent storm, and all  the
gullies many times. With a good spotter, I ski cut fairly deeply into  and
across the gully - nothing - the snow had not bonded to itself or the  layer
about 1 foot down. Three careful turns just skier's right of center and  it
felt OK - on my seventh turn the gully broke above me at turn three (50  feet
up) propagating rib to rib with about a 12-18 inch crown - - I saw the
rippling of snow buildup as I skied and my partner yelled to ski out  right.
- all was good as I skied our right and watched the gully run 800  vertical

ran was really a no-brainer. I have skied 10 out of the last 15 days and

Sunny, warm, no wind. Felt like a hot spring day on the up track. Beautiful. Skied from abut 1:45 PM to 3:30 PM. Avalanche occurred at about 3 PM.


8700 feet. East/Northeast facing slope. 30-32 degrees. Soft slab on buried surface hoar (AGAIN). Broke about 100-150 feet wide, ran about 100-200 feet down the slope into small aspen trees. Unintentionally triggered by a splitboarder.

No other cracking or instability observed.

No wind. This is a fairly protected area. SW aspects had a sun crust, but the N/NE aspects were soft, and did not show evidence of heavy wind loading.


8-12 inches of really nice, medium density powder. Small surface hoar crystals were observed on the up track, could be next weeks problem layer.


We skied a nearly identical slope to the one that fractured several times leading up to triggering this avalanche. I jumped on the top of these slopes in various spots, did a few ski cuts (this area makes high speed ski cuts off the ridgeline really easy) and pushed off some small cornices (lips really) trying to get any buried surface hoar to break out, but to no avail. On our final run we decided to ski a slightly different line, although very similar in aspect and slope angle to what we had spent the afternoon on. These two slopes are next to one another, separated by a small treed sub-ridge. I skied first, came to a stop half way down near some evergreens. Partner dropped in, but decided to cut across the slope nearer to my line when he triggered a very slow moving, shallow, but wide soft slab. He was able to stop and just watch as the slide run down the hill.

Some observations: There were ski tracks on the slope, left early today I think, which I followed. It seemed that whoever left those tracks had a dog with them, and that dog more or less center-punched the slope, putting tracks down the very area that broke out. (Release the avalanche poodle?) The dogs tracks were covered by this avalanche, but the pooch somehow managed not to trigger the slab when he ran through. The weak spot appears to have been up a little higher. Plus a human is a lot heavier...

There is one significant difference between the two slopes we skied today. The slope that fractured has a band of immature aspen trees running along the top, about 20 feet below the ridgeline. This further protects the area from wind that may have destroyed surface hoar on the other, successfully skied slope, and I think was one of the reasons the surface hoar persisted. The slab broke loose directly under these trees and propagated about 100-150 feet across.

Because the slope angle was right around 30 degrees the slab ran very slowly, and not very far. It ran into more young aspens where it came to a stop.

Only the new snow from yesterday's storm broke loose. It ran on what must have been more recent surface hoar crystals, rather than the  other persistent, and now deeper layer that has been causing havoc.

Incidentally, this is the same general area of the slides that Willie Holdman reported, although we did not see those.


Forecasts have been accurate. We looked for the weak, persistent layers as we skied - as I mentioned, lots of ski cuts, jumping, hand pits and so forth. We found the weakness, but it still caught us a little off guard, given the skiing we had already done without it revealing its presence. It may have been tha the heat of the day had warmed the new snow enough to sufficiently overload the weak layer so that we made an easy trigger. It shows the pockety nature of this beast, and how fickle it can be.

Comments Picture 1: Notice the band of aspens along the top of the slope. Splitboarder ready to enter the slope. Also notice the dog tracks running down the middle of the slope, and also mine from my last turn.

Comments Picture 2: Splitboarder made his first turn, and his heading across the slope. Notice the lightening bolt crack below him, and also the fracture behind and above him.

Comments Picture 3: More cracking below him, and the slope starting to move. I heard the slow whoosh of the slide before I actually saw the movement. Very cool, in an eery sort of way.

Comments Picture 4: The avalanche in full run. Small blocks, shallow, slow moving. Very manageable, but still got our hearts pumping.

Comments Picture 5: After the fact. My partner in the crown where he had stopped and watched. 
We both feel that had he made another turn into the slide (he saw the fracture and skied across and away from it) he would have been able to ski out from it safely, but his choice to cut across the slope ended up being a good one. This is an area that I have skied many times. It's a sort of ""go to"" spot when danger is high. Obviously this buried weak surface hoar does not care if I consider a particular slope ""safe"". The good news was the benign slope angle and the shallow nature of this slide meant we got a front row seat to another live demonstration of this persistent weakness. But still, not a show I want to see particularly often... or ever again for that matter.

The slide ran rather slowly allowing the skier to easily ski to a safe  area, it was remote triggered and broke about 50 feet above the skier.   Hoar frost from earlier weeks caused the slide apparently, we dug  several hand pits and one test pit that sheared four inches and  indicated no other weakness."

We saw several natural, shallow, soft slab avalanches at lower elevations along the creek bank in lower Mill D North on steep, east-southeast facing slopes.  These were 6 inches of new snow sliding on a pre-existing sun crust.  I could not find any surface hoar involved but they certainly acted like it.  We saw one slide while skiing up and 3-4 others nearby when we skied down that were not there when we skied up.  There was a high precipitation intensity in the morning, which, no doubt, contributed to the shallow instability.

Shooting about 100 yards in each direction. Luckily for the first rider he was able to run clear of it before it started to pile up. Person X was doing everything he could to stay behind it but his sled started sliding to fast and before he knew it he was caught right in the middle of it. He could feel the up and down wave like motion of the snow as it slid all around him, he then hit the first big wave which launched him fairly high out of the snow, then he came down only to hit the next big wave that launched him into the air endo'ing his sled and knocking him far away from it.

Now he was caught up in the slide tumbling down the hill swimming for his life.(at least he thinks he was swimming) He had a million thought going through his head as he tumbled with the slide. But mostly was thinking he needed to stay on top and keep his arms up which he felt was a way to let the others see him. In reality the snow dust cloud was so over whelming that neither of the 2 other riders could see him or his sled. One guy was up top and the other at the bottom. All they could see was a big cloud of snow.

To him it felt like he was tumbling and sliding forever catching glimpse of light and then darkness. As the slide started to come to a stop he was facing down hill on his hands and knees. But as he started to slow down he popped up and out of the snow, and was able to pull himself free.(extremely lucky)
the snow that settle around him was fairly light and fluffy at first, but with in a minute it has set up like concrete, which made getting the sled dug out really tough. He was 50 yards from his sled and the break line was 18"" deep
With the size of this slide the out come could of been alot worse. Very lucky to have made it out of it so easily. But he definitely came away with a new found respect of the mountain.""","","","","","",""

On the way up, we identified this trouble layer yet again and saw that it was below 8” of partially settled snow.  It was still reactive in our pits with CT14’s Q2.  We noted that while it was still reactive and not going away any time soon, there wasn’t that big of a slab on top of it on this specific slope and we felt like we could manage it.
I skied first and enjoyed fine powder turns until about ¾ of the way down when I came to the steeper breakover that caused trouble for two skiers one week ago.  They had a similar episode as us and may have broken some of the same rules.  I pulled up and ski cut the breakover anticipating the small slab that I found. It broke 10’ above me and propagated 40’ wide.  After digging in and letting it go by, I recognized the hoar that here was buried 14”.  I stopped to take a closer look and snapped these next three photos.

Because of the terrain, I was now out of sight with my partner and thought to myself that I should get moving because he didn’t know that I was still on the slope and also that I had triggered this slide. How many mistakes it this so far… Just then I was hit by a fast moving wall of snow that picked me up and cartwheeled me about 200’ before I came to rest mostly buried.  I had no chance to get out of the flow and stroked vigorously to stay close to the surface. I then got hit by another pulse of debris that moved me downhill a bit more and allowed me to swim closer to the surface.  When I finally stopped, I was facing downhill with only my head, right arm and tail of my right ski out of the snow.  I wiggled my right leg out and dug with my right hand to get the rest free.  I lost both poles, hat and glasses and later found the poles.

The slide above me was about 100’ wide and 14” deep and was triggered on a 37° slope by my partner who was carried a short way before stopping in some trees.  It traveled at least 500’vert. before hitting me. 
I often struggle with how to manage terrain that makes you lose sight of your partners, but that combined with not great communication at the top, a couple of curious avalanche guys, disregarding obvious signs of instability, a bluebird day, alluring powder, and some pesky buried surface hoar, you get the recipe for an accident.  We should know better!

we had skied steeper slopes during the day, although all had has some previous activity as indicated by old debris.
the mistake was not checking for the buried hoar as we had been during all day and assuming that since we had ski cut steeper slopes without debris that this one was not a big deal.  this demonstrates the pockety nature of the surface hoar.  the hangfire was very reactive.  column tests on the crown were very reactive, clean q1 shears on the surface hoar..

From top of Milli lift from Brighton 4 of us skinned out into Milli Bowl past Stupid Chute and up to the top of the bowl. We skied one run and on the second run the first skier dropped in and made 4 turns and just beyond the crest a 2- 2 1/2 foot fracture 80-100 feet wide broke loose. He rode it down almost buried (only head visable) and it came to a stop 100-120 yards down. He was buried up to waist and was able to dig out on own. 
Overcast, foggy, no wind around 30 degrees.

Snow was medium weight powder on top 2 feet and the slope angle was around 35-40 degree where the fracture occured. The debre at the bottom of slide was 3-4 feet deep. 
The slide let loose slowly--did no hear anything.
None
No new snow and it did not appear to be much wind loading.
I would pass by this line in the future.

Your Avalanche forcast for the day describes very much what happend in this incident. I can send photos later if you would like. Also the slide is visible from the top of the Milli lift.","","","","","",""

I had looked for surface hoar throughout the day because there were some surface hoar avalanches in the Ogden area mountains.  Despite lots of poking around, I did not find any and even one full depth pit in a representative spot showed very solid snow.  But we were watching our slope steepness very carefully and never got on anything much over 30 degrees all day.  But when several members of the party gathered to the side of a small opening in the trees to regroup, they noticed the slide coming down to the side of them.  No one is sure who triggered it.  Since it was on such a gentle slope it moved slowly and was not much of a hazard.
It slid on 5 mm surface hoar on a 1 finger bed surface, 1 foot deep, soft slab, starting about 10 feet wide and fanning out to 20 feet and moved only 100 feet down the slope. I measured the average slope steepness by sighting along the slope and it was an honest-to-god 29 degrees. There may have been one 5 foot section that was 30 degrees, but nothing steeper.
We did not find any other slopes with surface hoar except one tiny slab along a sub ridge.
Surface hoar is notoriously tricky because it can exist in pockets that can surprise you.  It also notoriously runs on gentle slope angles than you would expect from other kinds of weak layers. I measured this one at only 29 degrees. Interesting avalanche.","","It was easy to crack some hangfire but it was not steep enough for it to get going."

See the complete photo gallery.
Backcountry skier, Matt Knotts, triggered an avalanche, was caught, hit trees and suffered major injuries. He suffered open, tib-fib breaks on both lower legs and a broken left femur. Since it was obvious that he had suffered major injuries and needed prompt medical attention, is two partners used their cell phone to call for help. Wasatch Backcountry Rescue responded using Life Flight helicopters and quickly evacuated the patient (see the rescue summary).
A group of three backcountry skiers had skied to Wilson Peak, just east of Gobbler's Knob on the Big Cottonwood - Mill Creek ridge line.  They planned to ski into Alexander Basin, which is a very steep basin surrounded by large, steep slopes.  Since it is difficult to enter from the top, they went down the ridge off Wilson to the north and planned to ski a more gentle slope that the victim and other friends had successfully skied the previous day. They descended a bit too early and found themselves in terrain much steeper and more dangerous than they intended. Everyone felt uncomfortable about the terrain so they tried to traverse to their right to access the slope they planned to ski, but they were stopped by cliffs. They considered putting their skins on and climbing out but they noticed several other ski tracks from previous parties going down into the steep terrain and they thought they could probably make it as well. (The avalanche they triggered took out the pre-existing tracks.) 
Matt, the victim, skied last. Clay descended first and John descended an adjacent chute, which came back to join the main chute about a third of the way down.  When Matt began descending, he triggered the avalanche. He tried to move to the left in some trees as an island of safety but the slide took him down. He yelled ""avalanche"" to his two friends below and they quickly turned right and were out of the way of the avalanche and were not caught. Matt was strained through trees and he hit a couple trees very hard, breaking both legs and he came to rest in a group of trees on a small island at the side of the chute, where he was wrapped around a tree.
John and Clay helped stabilize him and quickly realized that he needed prompt medical attention with two open tip-fib fractures and a femur fracture. They had some difficulty using their cell phones as the reception was not very good. They tried calling Alta Central without success and they then called 911. John helped keep the victim warm by bear-hugging him and trying to keep him calm amid the great pain of his injuries.  

Air Med arrived and assessed that they would need professional avalanche help, so they picked up Brandon Dodge and another Brighton patroller (members of Wasatch Backcountry Rescue - a consortium of ski area avalanche professionals).  They landed on the debris and WBR members and medical personnel hiked 400 vertical feet up a very steep slope to access the victim, who was caught in trees on the flank of the slide.  They stabilized the patient with fluids and pain meds and lowered the patient in a liter using rope lowerings to the debris below where he could be loaded into a helicopter. Their prompt and expert response, no doubt, saved Matt's life and they were the real heros in this accident.
Rescue summary from Brandon Dodge who was part of the evacuation:
Salt Lake County SAR was activated at 1430 hrs for a backcountry skier injured in an avalanche. An Airmed helicopter was dispatched to locate and assess the scene. The Airmed crew located victims and decided to bring in outside snow safety personnel to assess avalanche hazard. A combination WBR, SAR, Airmed and Brighton Snow Safety team was flown to the scene and determined a hot landing zone was appropriate. Victim was hung-up about 500ft above deposition zone in large trees lining the side of the chute. A four person rescue crew ascended to victim. Victim was treated for severe injuries to both legs, stabilized, packaged and rope lowered 500 ft to Airmed helicopter.","","","See the "," After they realized they were in the wrong place and felt uncomfortable about the steepness and seriousness of the terrain.  They talked about putting on their skins and climbing back up and out, but saw all the other tracks from previous skiers who had descended successfully, so they decided to go for it.  The avalanche took out all the tracks from previous skiers.  Luckily after Matt yelled ""avalanche"", Clay and John got off to the side and were not caught.  Matt, unfortunately, was caught and impacted a couple trees at high speed and lodged in an island of trees.","A flank fracture where Brett is examining the weak layer. This shows the deepest section, which was about 3 feet deep, but most of the fracture was around 1.5 feet deep."," An overview of the area.
A close look reveals the gentler chute on the looker's left they intended to ski. Instead, they descended the chute on the looker's left of the fracture, where they triggered the avalanche. The initial avalanche sympathetically triggered the two other chutes on the right, making a much larger avalanche.  The victim was stopped in an island of trees at mid slope."

It sounded as if a bomb went off above my head and the trees began to shake as I saw giant 3 foot blocks coming right towards me. My partner yelled AVALANCHE!! to warn our friends above and I began to take off with the falling snow. All I could think about was grabbing one of the trees before I got going any faster and luckily there were some below me.
This is where I was buried up to my neck against the tree in the center right. When I slid right into the first one, I tried to bear hug it but my arms were ripped off like little tooth picks. I knew my only hope was the one just down to the left so I threw my arms around it and clung on for life as pounds and pounds of snow packed onto my back. All of this while trying to avoid the broken branches threatening to stab me as the snow kept coming. The majority of the moving snow ran right through that keyhole on the left. If I had been any farther out onto the slope, I would have run off into Mineral over all the exposed rocks.","","","This is the view from where I was digging my pit when the avalanche was triggered.

I began booting down through the trees looking for all of my camera equipment and avy gear. Luckily, my pack strap grabbed a branch along with my camera and lenses, my poles were showing and my shovel was sticking straight up out of another set of avalanche debris from this sympathetic slide just down and to the right of the first fracture. I took this photo from where I found my camera. There seemed to be another shear down to the left and I saw more debris against the trees even farther down but had no intention of going that far to investigate with all the hang fire still sitting above me. I still have no idea how far the collective debris went as the fog rolled in soon after.

It was obvious where the snowpack failed and if there was any mistake made, it was mine for stepping too far off the ridge to dig the pit. I know that this west face has a northerly component to it because of the imposing ridge and trees but I am still puzzled as to why this face was so incredibly different and more unstable than so many similar others I have observed recently. I guess we learn something everyday... even if it is the hard way. If all that I broke was a binding and all that I lost was a snow saw, I consider myself very, very lucky.","A closer look at the crown. The layers become very obvious."

Stace Fleming, 48, of Morgan, UT was caught and buried on Grandview Peak on January 29th, which is in the Session Mountains, east of the city of Bountiful. He died two days later on January 31. It occurred on a slope called ""Grand Slam"" by the Wasatch Helicopter Guides, who sometimes ski in the area. He was hill climbing in the area on his snowmobile and on his first descent of a steep, north facing slope, he triggered a very large avalanche and was buried about 5 1/2 feet deep. Apparently, he tried to outrun the avalanche but was bucked off, presumably by hitting the stauchwall of the fractured slab.

Wasatch Powderbird Guides happened to be skiing in the area with clients and they noticed the snowmobilers climbing in the area. The next time they looked, they noticed fresh debris with one person on the debris waving his arms. The victim had a beacon and so did his partner, but the partner had not yet located the victim when WPG landed. The guide, Steve Hall, immediately picked up a beacon signal and found the victim within a minute. Since the victim was buried about 5 1/2 feet deep, it took some time to dig him out but they still estimate the total burial time at 15-18 minutes. The victim was not breathing and did not respond to CPR. A medical helicopter was called and Air Med transported him to the hospital.

The snowmobile ended up on the surface.  The victim was buried horizontally, face up with his head down slope. He was wearing a helmet and face mask.

The avalanche fracture occurred around 9,000' on a north-northwest facing slope of about 38-40 degrees in steepness.  The slab fractured 3-4 feet deep, 250 feet wide, taking out the whole bowl and descended about 1000 vertical feet. From photos posted on the KSL News web site, it appeared that the avalanche fractured to the ground on faceted snow, similar to all the other avalanches this past week.

The avalanche danger rating from the Utah Avalanche Center was Considerable with pockets of High with strong warnings to avoid all slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  A Special Avalanche Advisory was also in effect issued through the National Weather Service.

The Wasatch Powderbird Guides were the real heros in this rescue. By pure luck, they just happened to be in the area and keeping an eye on the snowmobilers. The fast, and skilled rescue by guide, Steve Hall, was undoubtedly responsible for the live recovery.  Although the victim died a couple days later, we should all appreciate the rescue efforts by Wasatch Powderbird Guides, who have abandoned their guided skiing operations many times through the years to rescue other backcountry parties who have gotten into trouble.

Our condolences go out to the victim's family and friends.

You can see photos of the site from the KSL News helicopter ","","","","","","Photo by Dan Gardiner, who was snowmobiling in the area.  You can see the victim's tracks descending off the summit of a slope called ""Grand Slam"" by the Wasatch Powderbird Guides.  The fracture looks to be about 3 feet deep and over 200 feet wide on a very steep slope of about 40 degrees."

The group of 3, Ricardo Presnell (51), Joey and Sarah, met at the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon and carpooled up to the Solitude Parking lot.  Ricardo, the most experienced and a local, had chosen the tour, which he knew well.  He had been touring the previous six days and was familiar with the current snowpack situation.  
The group skinned to top of Meadow Chutes, in Silver Fork, and skied 2 laps on the upper, lower angel slopes. The third time down was their last, so at the bottom of the upper slopes, they continued down and slightly left, stopping above a large, open convex slope.  During this time they had seen no recent avalanches on similar slopes, saw any cracking, or heard any collapses.
Ricardo went first, telling other 2 to stay to the right of his tracks when they skied.  Ricardo disappeared over the break over after 5 turns.  A few seconds later, Joey and Sarah felt and heard a large collapse (whoomph).  Then saw a powder cloud and debris running up the opposite side of the valley below.  Joey immediately stated, “That’s him. We gotta go.”
Rescue:  Joey and Sarah moved down the ridge to where they could survey the whole scene.  Sarah made a kick turn and traversed into the trees away from the break over and called 911. She then became the communications coordinator, talking with rescue crews and Solitude patrol. Joey safely got onto the bed surface, and began a preliminary search, also looking for clues.  Down near the bottom, he got a signal, pin pointed Ricardo’s location, and probed.  On the 8th probe, he got a strike and started digging.
About 4’ down, Joey hit Ricardo’s boot, and that was when Ian, a Wasatch Backcountry Rescue (WBR) member from the Solitude Ski Patrol arrived, within 17 minutes of the initial 911 call.  Shortly after, two more Solitude patrollers arrived to help dig, and then more rescuers arrived. Ricardo was dug out in approximately 20 minutes.
Ricardo was buried about 4 feet deep, on his back, in a wide terrain trap formed by the valley bottom.  He was not breathing, had no pulse, and there were signs of trauma from the long ride.  Two aspens, one about 5” in diameter had to be sawed to get his body out of the hole.  The body was evacuated by WBR and the SL Co Sheriffs.
 ","","",""," Joey Klein, the skier in the party who initiated the rescue, stands in the burial hole.  The victim was buried about 4 feet deep, was face up and head toward the avalanche to the left.  The avalanche crossed the creek and partway up the opposite side.  Joey descended from the fracture and found the victim with his beacon, doing a textbook-perfect rescue. He dug for about 5 minutes before the Solitude Ski Patrol arrived and helped dig out the victim.  They had to saw through some aspen trees buried in the debris to free the victim."," Looking up at the fracture with a zoom lens from the bottom.  The victim triggered the avalanche by entering in the left third of the avalanche.  As you notice, many bushes and rocks are sticking up, as the avalanche fractured on the very weak, faceted snow near the ground.

Reviewed and Published by UAC staff.

Events leading up to the accident:
The 2009-10 season overall had lacked much of the snow that the local riders have grown
accustomed to. The powder days up through mid January had been few and far between.
The month of January was very dry and the snow conditions were thin and very worn out.
There was very little enthusiasm for any travel off of the main groomed runs. So when
there was a report of a large storm, anticipation for new snow was definitely high. The
riding conditions improved each day as the snow continued to fall. By the morning of the
24th 36 inches of new snow had made the riding conditions within the resort excellent.
For the backcountry there was an avalanche warning in effect and the danger rating was
extreme.

On the 24th of January, Ben Pett and Todd Bell had been skiing together all morning.
Both of them were familiar with the area as they had been skiing at Snowbasin for some
time. Todd was a former employee of the resort in the mid 90’s and had good knowledge
of the terrain. Todd and Ben decided to head up the John Paul lift and make a run in the No
Name area. No Name is known to be the premier powder terrain at Snowbasin ski resort
with a near continuous vertical drop of close to 3000 feet. Adjacent to No Name is easy
access into uncontrolled backcountry terrain of Hells and Coldwater Canyon.
On the lift ride up John Paul Ben stated that he and Todd had a discussion about how
dangerous the conditions were in the backcountry, and because of these conditions their
plan was to ski adjacent to the boundary in No Name all the way out to the bottom of the
Lower Pyramid. They travelled together to near the top of No Name peak where they
caught their breath and put their skis on. Once more they discussed their plan of skiing
near the boundary and staying in bounds. This was the last place/time Ben would see
Todd (approx. 13:00 to 13:05). Ben pushed off and skied a line next to the Gazex
exploder (No Name drain) and stopped in the trees on the skier’s left to look for Todd
(near the ridgeline and the top of “Lust”). He looked uphill, but didn’t see Todd. He
assumed that they had just gotten separated, so he continued down the run, skiing out the
Lower Pyramid and coming out at the power station. He stated he reached the bottom
around 13:15. Since Todd was planning to make this his last run, Ben wasn’t
immediately alarmed that his friend wasn’t there (or hadn’t waited for him). Ben was
confident that Todd would be OK because he knew the mountain very well and was an
excellent skier. Ben then called a friend, found out what car Todd was driving, and
discovered that his car was still in the parking lot. At this point, he became alarmed and
notified dispatch that Todd was missing. By the time he contacted the Ski Patrol they
were well into the recovery operation.
Ben stated that Todd was not wearing a beacon. Todd did have a pack, but likely was not
carrying a shovel or probe. Ben was wearing a beacon.
Jason Warner a friend of Todd’s also walked into dispatch and stated that Todd was a
good skier. He knew the area well, both inbounds and out of bounds. He was very
experienced in the area. He estimated that Todd had been skiing in Hell’s Canyon
hundreds of times.

Information from group of snowboarders on scene:
On their first “lap through No Name,” a group of 5 snowboarders left the ski area at the
top of No Name, passing the Forest Service brown sign. They noticed 4 or 5 tracks ahead
of them, likely snowboard tracks. None in the group carried beacons, shovels or probes,
although they usually do have all three with them (gear was in the car). Unaware if they
had checked the avalanche advisory that day.
They rode down the traditional “Sloth Ridge” route and likely rode down “Pride” into
“Anger Confluence.” At this point, they noticed fresh debris from an avalanche that had
come down near the run-out of “Lust.” They reported that it appeared to have run with
some speed and force, as it looked to have washed up over the bank on the observer’s left
of the slide path. They observed dirt in the slide path. Then they continued down
drainage, traversing to the skier’s right of the drainage and debris, attempting to make the
traverse back to the ski area They travelled approximately 100 yards past the confluence
with “Lust” when Nick spotted a jacket on the surface of the snow. The victim was on
their left, down in the bottom of the drainage. Nick skied down first and was
immediately joined by the rest of the group. They saw a person (Todd) buried in the
snow. He was sitting upright, leaning uphill, with legs bent, almost in a ball. He had his
feet downhill and head uphill. His head was covered by approx. 6 inches of snow, but
both knees and an arm were sticking out of the snow. He was found at the toe of the
debris. They described it like the snow had pushed him along to the very end of the slide.
Tony seemed to have a basic understanding of CPR and checked for a pulse. The victim
was unresponsive from the start. He did not detect a pulse and the victim was not
breathing. At this point they called 911 and the Weber County dispatcher instructed them
to begin CPR. They estimated reaching him at approx. 13:20 and made the 911 call at
approx. 13:22. They performed CPR for approximately 1 hour. They informed the
Weber County dispatcher that they were still in a slide path and likely in danger, but said
the dispatcher instructed them to continue CPR. The 911 dispatcher “called it” after one
hour and they stopped CPR.
A sixth snowboarder (a friend) was riding solo and joined the group at the scene some
time after they found Todd. This sixth person stated that he followed approximately the
same route as the rest of the group.
The victim was described as a male in his mid-40’s. He was wearing a blue jacket, black
pants and blue alpine ski boots. No skis or poles were found on scene. Nothing was on
his head (no goggles/hat/helmet/etc.). He was not wearing gloves, but they found 2
gloves, approx. 20 feet uphill from the victim. The gloves were black, Reusch “racing”
gloves. He was wearing a pack, but one of the straps had been broken.
The group did not have a beacon to mark the victim (in case of subsequent slides), but
they did make an “X” with branches to the skier’s left of the victim, up on a small ridge,
approx. 25-30 yards away, out of the slide path.
Snowbasin dispatch instructed the group to leave the scene and travel down canyon
where Ski Patroller Doug Wewer would meet them. Doug had left the ski area boundary
near the intersection of Mustache Ridge and the Dead Deer traverse and traversed to
Vanity Face. He skinned up from there and travelled to a small sub-ridge just West of
Vanity Face, where he could see the lower Hell’s Canyon drainage. The group informed
him that they travelled about 80 to 100 yards down canyon and around a bend before they
first made audible/visual contact with each other. Doug dropped into the drainage
bottom, met them, discussed the exit plan and escorted them to the power station. They
all walked together to dispatch and began paperwork.

Canyon. This group was mostly from Salt Lake City. Neil, the Ogden local, was the
group leader. At least some of the group had intended to ski at Snowbird that day, but the
canyon had been closed for avalanche control. They were aware that an avalanche had
crossed the Little Cottonwood Canyon road and had delayed its reopening. Because of
the closure, they decided to make the trip north to Snowbasin.
The group exited the ski area at the top of No Name around 1pm, approximately 1 hour
after the No Name sign line opened. They passed by the Forest Service brown sign and
the “Are You Beeping Sign.” All 5 were carrying beacons, probes and shovels. Neil had
taken a Level 2 avalanche class. Greg had taken a Level 1 class. None of the other group
members identified an avalanche education level. Neil stated that he had dug a few pits,
but didn’t say where.
After looking at backcountry photos of the area, Neil the only person familiar with the
area didn’t seem to be able to pick out exactly where they had travelled.
Neil’s description of the events is that they rode down the Hell’s/Taylor’s ridgeline to the
top of Coldwater. See the overview diagram for more details. The first avalanche they
triggered Neil described as being 3-4’ deep, 200’ wide. They continued downward and
triggered another slide, 3-4’ deep and 150’ wide. Neil did not know how far either of
these slides ran.
At this point, they began traversing skier’s right, hoping to reach the Hell’s/Coldwater
ridgeline (Sloth Ridge) before or at the saddle (Redemption Saddle). They were aware of
the steep rocky cliffs in Coldwater Canyon beyond Redemption saddle and were trying to
avoid them. Neil said his goal was to gain the ridge and get onto a south-facing aspect
where he felt the avalanche hazard would be safer.
They triggered the third and largest avalanche while making this traverse. It was 3-4’
deep with one part of the crown reaching 7-1/2’ deep. Neil said he stood at the crown
and it was over his head. Dan was at the edge of this crown when the slide fractured on
the uphill side of his board. He felt like a rug was being pulled out from underneath him
and he fell down, landing on the crown. He ended up sitting on the edge of the crown,
like a bench, with his feet and snowboard dangling in the air below him. Despite this
close call, none of the group was caught or carried in any of the slides. From looking at
photos, it appears that the second and third slides slid at or near the ground.
Neil stated that they practiced safe travel protocols throughout the day, travelling one at a
time from “safe point” to “safe point” and making ski cuts.
At this point, the group decided to boot-pack uphill, possibly using some of the bed
surface of this slide. It is unclear how high they hiked, but it apparently wasn’t high
enough. They began traversing again, but could not reach redemption saddle. They
travelled to a location just west of Redemption saddle, likely several 100 yards below the
ridgeline and called for assistance. They were told to stop moving, and a helicopter
would fly over the scene, locate them and decide the best way to get them out. Ski
Patroller Frank Wakart flew in the helicopter to help spot. When Frank flew over the
area, he observed debris from numerous other avalanches. His recommendation to the
group was to not move anywhere and stay put until they could be rescued by helicopter.
Travel down Coldwater Canyon would have been a very dangerous option. Rescue was
delayed because of the avalanche accident and recovery occurring simultaneously in the
adjacent Hell’s Canyon.
Rescue Summary:
Initial call 13:28. Call came through Weber County via the party on scene. Initial call
came in as one unconscious not breathing victim that was on the surface, and no one else
to be known missing or injured. Location given was No Name.
Net message made to the patrol of the event and to stand by at 13:30.
Kory Kruse provided information of a new avalanche skiers right Upper Pyramid.
Based on this information sent out a hasty party of Doug Wewer, Hans Hjelde, and Will
King along with Pivot an avalanche rescue dog to the top of the Pyramid. They stood by
at this location for further information.
Holly Ahern closed No Name gate 1 and went to the Gaz-Ex building to meet Tyson
Woolsey. They talked to guests in the area and tried to send them back into the main
John Paul terrain.
The remainder of No Name sign line was closed by 13:50.
The team on the Upper Pyramid sent out Doug Wewer to ski the boundary and try to get
a visual on the Upper Pyramid and Hells Canyon to see if he could determine where this
incident was. He worked his way to Vanity. But still could not determine the location of
the accident.
Also during this time there was another call from a group reported to be in UFO. They
stated that they had kicked off numerous avalanches and were in a precarious position.
UFO was unfamiliar to the patrol, but sounded like WFO, so ski patrol was sent to WFO
to investigate. It was later determined in further conversation that they were in Cold
Water Canyon. Dispatch made note of a group traveling in this terrain.
A call from Life-Flight came in that they were dispatched to the scene. Because Life-
Flight was flying it was decided to let them fly and try to find out where the incident was.
On their fly over they could not find anything. They landed and picked up Frank Waikart
who flew with them to help spot. He did see the location in the main drainage of Hell’s
Canyon. At this time the decision was made by Weber County dispatch that this was a
fatality.
It was also decided that the six individuals on scene would exit down the drainage and
meet up with Doug Wewer to be escorted to Ski Patrol Dispatch.
After some discussion about the hazard of the victims location with all of the slide paths
above that had not slid. A few options were discussed. 1) Use explosive to control all of
the snow above and then do the recovery from the top down. 2) Come in from the
bottom make a quick recovery and get out. This was based on the assumption that the
avalanche paths above would not slide naturally. Number 2 was decided on. The
recovery plan was to send a group of five down the boundary and into the Hells drainage.
From there they would skin up to the victim’s location and do the recovery with a SKED.
Recovery party of Hans Hjelde, Will King, Cory Davis, Ryan Woolsey, and Holly Ahern
as a spotter departed at 3:30.
Recovery party was on scene at 4:25 PM.
Leave scene at 4:50 PM.
Recovery party out of danger at 5:00 PM.
Recovery party to Maples gate to meet Weber County at 5:10 PM.
Before the recovery operation was started another phone call came in from the Cold
Water Canyon group. They were concerned about their ability to safely get out from
where they were. They were told to not move, and a Helicopter would be sent to find
their location and see what could be done to assist them.
Frank Waikart met the Helicopter at 3:45 PM in the base area and they flew over Cold
Water canyon. The group of five were spotted low in the canyon below Redemption
Saddle and it was determined that the best method to get them out was by hoist.
The hoist operation began at 4:13 PM
Last person down and safe at 5:23.
Life Flight departs the scene at 5:36.
Involved Snowbasin Patrol was debriefed at 6:00 PM.
Operation completed at 6:30.","","","Original observations from the group:

I snapped this photo of Cardiff Bowl as I found this route interesting.  I noted some plumes coming off the ridge at the time loading the left side of the slope somewhat.  It is not uncommon to see this route get used.  The route is poor because you are obviously exposed the entire time you are walking across the slope.  A better route is to stay on the ridge.  I thought it was a possibility that the person who cut the traverse and skied the run may have felt comfortable there after seeing the bomb hole from UDOT control work.  As I understand it, the UDOT crew cannot get any shots farther to the lookers left because of the angle from the gun, so this is where it usually goes.  It would be more desireable to get the shot off to the left a bit more as there is more weak underlying snow there."

A party of skiers were breaking a trail up east-facing Cardiac Ridge.  As they neared the top of the ridge, they triggered an avalanche from below, which broke out about 100 feet above them.  The avalanche caught the last skier on the up track, carried him down and buried him about 2.5 feet deep.  The others responded immediately and as they approached with their beacons on receive, they saw the tip of a ski pole sticking out.  They pulled on it and it was attached to his wrist.  They reported to have dug him out in about a minute and recovered without injuries.
They reported that they felt several collapses previously but did not think there was enough snow to create a dangerous avalanche.  The wind was blowing the snow near the ridge, so they assumed that it was a wind slab, which likely collapsed on the very weak faceted snow.
Accident account from one of the party members:
Group of 4.
 
Triggered near top of Cardiac Ridge. Triggered remotely by leading
skinner. Skin track was hugging the north side rocks and heading
southeast. Heard a whumph and felt a collapse. Felt slab under me move
a bit and then stop. Also saw shooting crack go up. Then a soft slab
about 40 to 50 feet across and about 75 feet above and to climber's
left pulled out.
 
Soft slab ran on wind blown layer from earlier in week. Slab ran about
300 to 400 feet. Slab consisted of new snow from last night. I think
there was a windslab above that formed as a result of winds blowing
over the top of the ridge. There were times when trail breaking was
knee deep.

3 climbers were out of the path. I stood through some snow running
boot height. The 4th climber took a direct hit and was carried a bit
over 250 feet. He was deposited in a low spot before a roll over and
buried perpendicular to slope. His head was about 2 feet under. He
was lying face up. One pole was still attached and the tip was
visible and enabled us to locate him immediately. Both skis were on
 -- dynafit toe pieces locked. Lost one pole in the ride.
 
We dug, following the pole and cleared an airway within about 3 or 4
minutes after he was buried. His face had color and he was fully
conscious. I don't think he would have been able to dig himself out
without assistance. He took a big breath when airway was cleared.
 
There were definitely warning signs. I felt a couple collapses. We
deliberately stuck to sub ridges and spread out. I didn't think the
new snow was enough to cause deep slab failure. I also didn't think
that there was enough new snow to be too much of a problem. Had the
4th climber been 5 feet to the left or right, he probably would have
been fine. He was in exactly the wrong spot at the wrong time.

Over confident. Over exuberant with new snow and early season.
Hopefully this report will quell others'.","","","","","",""

They went to terrain with gladed trees that is almost entirely less than 30 degrees in steepness, which is generally considered to be very safe terrain. On their climbing track back up, Tom Diegel was breaking trail and he got a little farther to climber's left than usual and they came to a small opening in the trees that was 29 degrees in steepness at least a the bottom of the slope, which is not generally steep enough to slide in most conditions.  But the upper section of the small opening had a short section that was 32-33 degrees in steepness.  
Tom noticed that the slope above them was slightly steeper.  So, to be safe, they decided to cross it one at a time.  Tom and Paul crossed the slope and waited on the other side.  When the third person, Matt Clevenger, began to cross, the entire slope collapsed and it slid, very slowly, down into some trees, catching both Matt and Dan, who were carried only about 10-15 feet down the slope where Matt was pushed up against a large fir tree and buried with his head between 4 and 6 feet deep (6 feet on the uphill side and 4 feet on the downhill side) and buried upright but hunched over.  Paul was buried to his knees just a few feet away.  The rest of the avalanche went only about 100 feet down slope before coming to a stop on the gentle terrain.

Luckily, Tom Diegel regularly practices with his beacon and often practices deep burials.  He located the victim in about two minutes in deep debris piled up against trees.  He probed, hit him and organized the others and they began to dig.  He knew it was a deep burial so two of them dug while the third helped move snow away from the hole.  Since the victim was pushed up against a large, fir tree, they could not dig in from the downhill side so they dug straight down from above and they also had trouble digging through all the branches.  They uncovered Matt's face in about six minutes but it could have been as long as 10 minutes from the time of burial.  Matt groaned when they uncovered his face, but he was blue-faced and unresponsive.  Tom could not tell if he was breathing on his own or not so he gave him some rescue breaths and Matt began to respond.  They extricated him from the snow and Matt completely recovered but was very cold and shivering.  He was able to ski out on his own and even climb to the top of the ridge to descend the other side to the car.  It was a miraculous recovery considering the depth of the burial.","","","Although, they should have found an alternative route around this particular terrain feature, this story has a happy ending, first because the party was knowledgeable and experienced enough to choose conservative terrain and carry proper rescue gear, and second, because Tom had been regularly practicing with his beacon using realistic scenarios, such as deep burials with a beacon in a buried pack.  He is an accomplished outdoorsman with extensive experience, so he is used to dealing with high-risk situations and training for them.  He indicated that his regular practice doing realistic drills with deep burials probably made the critical difference.  He did not have to think, and he could quickly spring into action with little wasted effort.  In addition, he is one of the most aerobically fit outdoor athletes in Utah and regularly places very high in competitions such as randonee rally, running and bicycle races.  Paul and Dan are also very fit outdoorsmen and contributed significantly to the rescue efforts.  Finally, Matt, the victim, is a very fit athlete, which probably contributed to his survival, both during the burial and his ability to ski out on his own afterwards.  In short, because of their training and team effort, one person is alive in a story that could easily have an unhappy ending.
Despite this, obviously mistakes were made.  Tom Diegel was breaking trail and was the default decision maker at the time.  As he noted on the video I took of their party a couple days later when we visited the site, he looked up the slope and noticed that it became slightly steeper above, but it just did not register as being overly dangerous.  The slope where he crossed was only 28-29 degrees, so he was lulled into the belief that it would be safe enough to cross.  He was concerned enough to tell the others that they should cross it one at a time.  In retrospect, he noted that he should have gone back downhill and crossed through the trees much lower on the slope.  The other skiers did not object to his choice of the route, or if they did, no one spoke up.  One person had skied there a couple days earlier and was more familiar with the terrain.  As Tom noted later, he was cold and wanted to warm up, plus he enjoys breaking trail as exercise, so he was in front.  Also, the two people in the rear were still in the thick trees, so they may not have even seen the slope before Tom broke a trail across it.
In our avalanche classes, we usually teach the students to use the ALPTRUTh and FACETS checklist, invented and popularized by Ian McCammon, as a way to assess avalanche danger and the human factors that may affect decisions.  So I will go through those checklists here as well as an after-the-fact exercise.

 In the ALPTRUTh system, you should avoid a slope if you get more than 3 checks and they had 5.5 checks here.  I gave the avalanche path a half-check because it was neither very steep nor large, so an inexperienced person may not have recognized it as avalanche terrain, but it should have been an obvious path to someone with lots of avalanche experience.   The increasing steepness above them did not quite register.  If this was more obvious avalanche terrain, they probably would not have crossed the slope.  Everyone in the party recognized the avalanche hazard that day.  That is why they decided to ski in conservative terrain.  They just did not recognize the problem with that particular terrain feature, or if anyone had concerns, they did not speak up.
Second, research clearly shows that human factors cause many, if not most, avalanche accidents, so I will use Ian McCammonÕs FACETS checklist.  These are ÒheuristicsÓ or mental shortcuts that tend to make people take more risks in the presence of these clues.

            Familiar terrain  - when   you are in familiar terrain, you tend to take more risks.  All of them had skied there before   and knew the area.  One person   had been there two days earlier.

            Acceptance – We all want acceptance from our peers, and   especially from potential mates, so we tend to ÒperformÓ in ways that gain   acceptance .  Since they were the   only group in the area that day and their group was composed of all males,   seems less important.  But   acceptance is a factor in any group.    For instance, I doubt that anyone was consciously trying to impress   the others, but unconsciously, this occurs in most all groups.  Tom knew the others only as casual   acquaintances, so it is possible that he was unconsciously trying to be   accepted by breaking trail for them and the others may have wanted acceptance   by not speaking up if they felt it was a dangerous route.

            Commitment – when we are committed to a goal, belief or identity,   it simplifies our decisions because we choose based on what supports our   commitment.  In this case, there   was no goal for the day except to ski in an area they believed was safe   terrain, so there appears to be no commitment heuristic present.
            
            
             
            
        
        
            
            Expert halo – people tend to take more risks when they   are following an ÒexpertÓ.    Sometimes the expert is just the person who knows the route or they   may have the strongest personality.   In this case, they may have seen Tom as an expert   because he had more backcountry experience than the rest of them, plus, he   has a strong, confident personality and the others are softer spoken.

            Tracks – or scarcity--when there are other parties   in the area competing for the limited resource of powder, we tend to take   more risks.  No other parties   were in the area that day and there was plenty of powder, so this was not a   factor.
            
            
             
            
        
        
            
            Social Proof – which I call the Òherding   instinctÓ—when we look to others for proof that what we are doing is   correct.  Most of us simply   follow the crowd instead of go against the flow.  This was probably present in this accident as they were all   following the trailbreaker and no one questioned his route, or if they did,   no one spoke up.  In their   defense, the last two people, who were also the ones caught, were in thick   trees, so they may not have even seen the complete slope until Matt stepped   out onto it and the avalanche occurred.    Our brains are hard wired for safety-in-numbers and this often gives   us a false sense of security.    This is called Òrisky shiftÓ in the business community, when larger   committees tend to take more risks.    Would anyone in that party have crossed that slope if he were skiing   alone?  Probably not.
            
            
            X
            
        
    

Other human factors include what is known as Òloss aversionÓ.  In other words, once you gain something, you will do almost anything to avoid loosing it.  In this case, after they gained some elevation, they did not want to drop back down to a safer crossing because they would have lost some of their hard-gained elevation.  Tom is very fit and he enjoys breaking trail, so it was probably not much of a factor, but it is a powerful heuristic that affects us all.  Going back the way they came—even for a short distance—is a choice that few people ever consider.
The weather may have contributed to the accident as well, because it was cold.   Tom started out breaking the trail because he wanted to warm up.  Other party members were more familiar with the more standard route up the nearby sub-ridge, which avoids the particular terrain feature that avalanched.
Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court was designed many years ago, so that one justice always wrote a dissenting opinion on important, close decisions.  Early courts recognized the risks with social proof and acceptance heuristics.  They found that if someone always took the ÒdevilÕs advocateÓ position, it forced the majority to reexamine their beliefs and address the problems in their logic illuminated by the contrary position.  Similarly, in backcountry decisions, I feel that it is important not only for members to speak up when they see a problem, but for a leader to always ferret out other opinions from others in the group.
We have found these checklists useful, not only for judging danger before an accident, but as a post-accident debriefing.  My report probably misjudged some of these factors, especially the human factors, which are subjective and uncertain.  Regardless, we see a lot of checks in the boxes above.
We write these comments not to lay blame or judge, because we all make these same mistakes, but we use it as a way for others to learn.  Telling stories is our most ancient learning method and it works well for avalanche accidents.

The party triggered a huge hard slab avalanche, which buried and killed two close friends, 22-year-old Erik Jorgensen of Paradise and 23-year-old Jesse Johnson of Hyrum. 
The avalanche was reported to authorities at around 10:30 am via satellite phone by a member of a separate snowmobiling party. About twenty snowmobilers, who were riding in the area, helped the surviving members of the party with the rescue attempt. From what I could piece together at the scene, one of the victims was very deeply buried in the heavy debris (10-12’ deep). The other was recovered in the vicinity of a grove of large spruce and fir trees. Survival of such a deep burial in avalanche deposition is extremely rare, and trauma due to impacting trees while carried by an avalanche accounts for around 25% of avalanche deaths in North America.
The victims were recovered with the aid of avalanche transceivers, which each wore, and probes and shovels. After previous avalanche incidents in the area, extra probes and shovels are cached at a nearby warming hut by Cache Search and Rescue (Cache County Sheriff) and local snowmobilers…. Members of CSAR and the flight crew of the responding Life Flight medical rescue helicopter were unable to resuscitate the two young men.","","","CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS","","",""

Baldy and watched the avalanche initiate; the crown face bisected the high traverse. The event occurred as they were crossing the slope but did not involve them. According to witness reports from near the starting zone, as the slide was in motion they spotted a person in the middle of the track who was hiking up the slope to retrieve a ski. Warnings were yelled, but when visibility returned, the slope was empty, the alarm was sounded to the ski patrol, and many public skiers and snowboarders in the area began a search for missing people. A hasty search team was immediately dispatched with dogs, beacons, and Recco. Probe teams were assembled and dispatched along with extra probes for the public on scene already searching. Due to approximately 150 people on site, their scattered equipment, and the resulting contamination of the deposition, the dogs had interest in numerous locations but were unable to locate the victim. The victim, a 27-year-old female, was the same person who had been seen hiking in the track.

The three remaining skiers on the ridge saw the avalanche break behind the second skier.  One member commented that he saw the slab flow up and over the stock wall.  The three skiers on the ridge began shouting and were getting a garbled response from below.  One of the skiers on the ridge instructed everyone to switch their beacons to receive and immediately began descending the slide path.  It was immediately apparent that the avalanche had carried the victim through a stand of rugged alpine pine.

The first skier was not caught in the slide, and was already attempting to free the victim when the skiers who had been on the ridge arrived at the victims location.  The victim was wrapped abdomen first around a tree, another tree pinning his back in place.  Blood was present, and it was clear that the victim had sustained serious trauma during the avalanche.

While the group made a serious lapse in judgment skiing the slope, they did execute a great rescue.  The tree pinning the victim was removed, as was the snow surrounding his torso.  Next they constructed a makeshift stretcher and alerted emergency response teams via cell phone to their predicament.  The emergency teams informed the group that they would need to get the victim down to Red Pine lake to meet outside help.  One member of the group broke trail while the other three did their best to support & move the victim.  The party lowered the victim some 200 vertical feet to the lake where they met Canyons ski patrol who then took control of the situation and loaded the victim & group into the waiting snowcat.  When the snowcat reached a suitable heli landing location, the victim was loaded into the medical helicopter and flown to the local hospital.  He arrived at the hospital hypothermic with a broken pelvis, vertebrae as well as other injuries.

The Utah Avalanche  Center had rated the danger as “MODERATE” for terrain above 8,000’, meaning that human triggered avalanches are possible.  The forecaster commented that he’d be “surprised if we don't hear about any (avalanche activity) after the day is done.”","","","The group was composed of 5 expert skiers.  Avalanche skills/education among the group ranged from a former ski patroller to no formal avalanche education with most of the group having attended a level 1 class.  Unfortunately, only one member of the group had read the avalanche forecast in its entirety.  Had the group known of the nearby large avalanches the day before the accident, would they have still skied the slope?  It’s tough to say. 
 
It’s always easy to see what went wrong in hindsight, and this accident is no exception.  Most of the group had skied this terrain before, falling into the Familiarity trap.  Before descending the ridge, the group had committed to the idea of not turning back aka, the Commitment heuristic.  It’s likely that there was some Social Facilitation at play as two members of the group had more backcountry experience than the other three.  One member of the group states that he did not feel good about the decision making going on, but, fell victim to the Expert Halo heuristic and didn’t voice his concerns.  I invite anyone interested in these Heuristic Traps to check out Ian McCammon’s work in the area.  All the snow science training in the world will not keep you out of avalanches when these powerful heuristic forces are at work.  This was an expensive lesson for the 4 men and one woman involved, especially the victim who remains in the hospital with numerous serious injuries.

Snowmobiler caught in avalanche dies
December 31st, 2007 @ 10:01pm


Sarah Dallof reporting
An Altamont man died in an avalanche while snowmobiling with friends and family in Summit County.
""It was a significant slide. It took the snow right down to dirt level,"" authorities said.
Dale Christensen, 40, was flown by helicopter to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, where he was pronounced dead.
 

The avalanche happened near the Co-op Creek area in Summit County, about 10 miles east of Heber City, near Strawberry Reservoir.
Ron Hazard, of the Wasatch County Sheriff's Office, said, ""The slide was about 200 feet wide and 1,000 feet long, and it took the snow down to dirt and rocks.""
The massive slide hit three snowmobilers who were fixing one of the men's machines Monday afternoon.   Two swam out; the third was buried for about 45 minutes.
""We started CPR immediately, and LifeFlight came in and transported the victim with CPR in progress,"" Hazard said.
Christensen wasn't wearing an avalanche beacon.
""I don't know what else to say. It's dangerous out there, and the snow needs to be respected,"" Hazard said.
This is the third avalanche to bury people in just over a week.   The first, on Dec. 23, has been described as a freak occurrence, taking place in-bounds at The Canyons resort.
Two people were swept away:  30-year-old Jesse Williams hit a tree and died.   An 11-year-old boy survived.   The area had just recently been opened. The resort said there were no indications it was unstable.
Mike Goar, of The Canyons, said at the time, ""Conditions can change sometimes by the minute, and we felt good about it again, the fact it was open for skiing yesterday, the stability of that general area, and it was OK to be opened.""
Then on Christmas, a second slide and a second death. This time 53-year-old Dave Balls was snowmobiling with his family when a wall of snow buried him near Thousand Peaks Recreation Park.
Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds said, ""I actually know the individual very well and know the family. It's very difficult for me personally, [to be] the bearer of such bad tidings.""
Avalanche danger in the Western Uintahs is just below extreme right now.   The Wastach Mountains are almost as dangerous.
Just one more reminder to be prepared and know the conditions before you head out.",""

Desert News
Authorities are warning of increased avalanche danger as more storms move across Utah.
It comes as the second avalanche fatality of the week struck in the backcountry near Oakley, in Summit County. Authorities said 53-year-old Dave Balls was snowmobiling in an area known as the Super Bowl on the east side of Windy Beak in the Whitney Basin area on Tuesday when he died in an avalanche.
""He was buried for over an hour and a half,"" the Utah Avalanche Center said in a statement on its Web site Wednesday. ""He was not wearing a beacon and was found with an organized probe line.""
Authorities were expected to investigate the cause of the slide today. The Utah Avalanche Center said the slide was as much as 400 feet wide and 4 feet deep.
""Wind loading on a weak faceted snowpack is the most likely structure,"" the Web site utahavalanchecenter.com said.
Balls' family released a statement Wednesday saying David was snowmobiling with his sons in an area they were all familiar with. Balls and his sons were ""very experienced"" snowmobilers, the statement said.
He was the founder and owner of Valley Ready Mix, which he ran with his brother-in-law Brent Baker.
Balls is the second person to die in an avalanche this week. An 11-year-old boy is making a remarkable recovery after he was buried for 33 minutes in an avalanche on Sunday.
Max Zilvitis was one of three skiers trapped in an avalanche on an inbounds trail at The Canyons. Jesse R. Williams, 30, of Grand Junction, Colo. died of head trauma when the slide carried him into a tree. Zilvitis and his father, Brian, were also caught in the slide.
""A man and a child below were engulfed, with the man partially buried and the child totally buried,"" according to a report from the Avalanche Forecast Center.
""The father was able to dig himself out while his son remained completely buried. The ski patrol arrived and performed an outstanding rescue. They set up a probe line using volunteers on the scene. Within minutes, there was a strike by a 15-year-old girl that was on the probe line that the snow safety had organized, and the boy was excavated from the debris with no pulse or respirations.""
Monday afternoon Max regained consciousness and has made dramatic improvement each day. Wednesday, Primary Children's Medical Center listed him in good condition and said he had been taken out of intensive care.
Brian and Samantha Zilvitis, of Park City, released a statement Wednesday about their son's recovery.

More snowmobilers getting caught in avalanches
December 26th, 2007 @ 6:02pm

 John Hollenhorst reporting 
More snow fell today, and more is in the forecast, all adding to the danger of an avalanche season that has killed two people in the past few days.
The most recent fatality is David Balls of Oakley. He died yesterday while snowmobiling in the mountains above that town. That death highlights a strong trend that's taken place over the last 30 years: Snowmobiling has replaced backcountry skiing as the leading cause of fatal avalanches.
A lot of people feel very powerful when they're on a snowmobile, but they are no match for the power of nature when snow starts to slide. Backcountry skiers have learned the hard way for many years. In recent years, snowmobilers have been forced to learn the same lessons.
 

A safety video put together by the Utah Avalanche Center shows that winter sports can be exhilarating, spectacular and terrifying. ""Getting caught in an avalanche is kind of like being in a car wreck. I mean you just don't want to be in one,"" one skier says.
Daredevil backcountry skiers and mountain climbers used to be the recreationists most at risk. But since the 1980s, avalanches are increasingly a phenomenon of snowmobiles.
""It used to be snowmobiles couldn't get back into areas that normally people could hike or ski into,"" explained Eric Stucki, of Utah State Parks and Recreation.
New powerful machines now routinely go where angels fear to tread.
For a half century, avalanche deaths have been steadily increasing. Over time, the death rates have shifted. Skier and climber deaths have declined, relatively, while snowmobiler deaths have shot up to about 40 percent of all avalanche deaths.
 

Experts now stress avalanche training and equipment--probe poles, locater beacons, and shovels--for all backcountry snowmobilers, and the safety gear ought to be on the rider, not the machine, in case they get separated.
""They're just kind of on the back side of the learning curve a little bit maybe,"" Brett Kobernick, of the Utah Avalanche Center, said. ""They're kind of in the same boat that skiers and snowboarders were 10 or 15 years ago.""
The goal, of course, is to never have to use avalanche tools, to avoid going into areas when they're dangerous. ""As long as you check the forecast, as long as you know before you go, I think they can go back into those areas, as long as they are prepared,"" Stucki said.
In other words, get information so you know when to go and when to stay home. ""Keep in contact with what the current conditions are, and that way they can make wise and informed decisions when they travel into the backcountry,"" Kobernick said.
The Utah Avalanche Center now provides forecasts specifically tailored to snowmobilers, and they do educational programs for all sorts of different groups.
The experts Eyewitness News talked to say the message is sinking in, and snowmobilers are much more safety conscious than they used to be.

OAKLEY, Utah, Dec. 26 (UPI) -- A father of six was killed in a 400-foot-wide avalanche in Summit County, Utah, the second victim of a local avalanche this week.
Bishop Howard Sorensen, a local religious leader, said Dave Balls, 53, was snowmobiling with his four sons when he was unable to avoid the avalanche and was lost in a wave of snow, The Salt Lake Tribune reported Wednesday.
""He was up enjoying the day when the slide broke loose,"" Sorensen said of accident Tuesday. ""He just wasn't able to out run (it).""
Along with his four sons, who managed to avoid the avalanche, Balls had two adopted daughters from Russia, the Tribune said.
The newspaper said that Balls' death came in the wake of last weekend's avalanche in Summit County that claimed the life of 30-year-old Colorado native Jesse R. Williams. In addition to killing Williams, Sunday's avalanche at the Canyons ski resort also critically injured an 11-year-old boy.

A man was killed and a boy critically injured Sunday morning when an avalanche swept over them while they skied within the bounds of The Canyons Resort. It was the first death of the avalanche season. The skiers were in the Red Pine Chutes area when the avalanche began just after 11:15 a.m., said resort spokeswoman Elizabeth Dowd. The man - 25 to 35 years old and possibly a Colorado resident - was found about 10 minutes later, but died at the scene, she said. A friend of the man suffered minor injuries. The 11-year-old was skiing at the bottom of the double black-diamond run with his father when he was caught up in the slide, Summit County sheriff's Capt. Andrew Leatham said. Three women witnessed the avalanche; one found the boy about 30 minutes later with her ski pole. Rescuers performed CPR, and the boy was flown to Primary Children's Medical Center, Leatham said. As of late Sunday afternoon, the boy was in intensive care and doctors were warming his core temperature, he said. The slide occurred within resort boundaries, in an area that had opened Saturday, Dowd said. Explosives, a snow pack assessment and a test ski had been administered at the avalanche site less than a day before the slide, she said. ""Aggressive avalanche control work had been performed at The Canyons throughout the week as new snow fell,"" she said. Investigators didn't know what triggered the slide, which was 125 feet wide and 500 feet long. The depth ranged from 3 inches to 5 feet. Avalanche deaths are ""very rare"" in ski resorts, said Brett Kobernik, forecaster for the Utah Avalanche Center. ""It's only happened a handful of times since the resorts have opened here,"" he said. The avalanche danger in the area Sunday was considerable, according to the center, which warned that dangerous human-triggered slides were likely. The risk was expected to remain today, Kobernik said. ""The avalanche danger will be on the rise again on the back country . . . due to more snow and stronger winds,"" he said.

Man killed, boy injured in avalanche at The Canyons

Deseret News

Published: Sunday, Dec. 23, 2007 7:40 p.m. MST

 

An avalanche at The Canyons resort in Park City left one man dead and a juvenile critically injured late Sunday morning.
The avalanche at the ski resort occurred at 11:17 a.m., according to the Summit County Sheriff's Office. Skiers who saw the crash and Canyons ski patrol teams were on the scene within minutes. Sheriff's deputies also were called to the area of the slide.
Eight minutes after the avalanche, the body of a man between the ages of 25 and 30 was found. Paramedics immediately began attempting resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.
Twenty-five minutes after the first man was found, an adolescent boy was discovered and pulled from the snow and ice. He was unconscious but later was revived and taken to a Salt Lake area hospital, said Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds. Sunday night he was reported in critical but stable condition.
Neither the identity nor the hometown of either person was released Sunday evening, pending family notification, Edmunds said. Police did not believe Sunday that the two had any relation to one another.
The man and boy were found within bounds near the Red Pine Chutes area, according to The Canyons spokeswoman Elizabeth Dowd. Officials are unsure whether the avalanche, which they called of substantial size, started within bounds.
The Canyons has participated in aggressive avalanche control in the area of Sunday's slide, Dowd said. Explosives and other safety measures were performed within 24 hours of the fatal avalanche.
However, the Utah Avalanche Center has listed slide danger in the area of the western Uintas as considerable. The center does not list specific data for The Canyons on its Web site at www.avalanche.org.
Sunday's fatal slide caused The Canyons resort's second death within just eight days. On Dec. 17, a Park City attorney died after striking a tree and breaking his neck near the Lower Crowning Glory run at the resort.
So far in winter 2007, Utah has seen three injury-causing avalanche accidents. according to the avalanche center. The first two occurred Dec. 13 at Pioneer Ridge and Hidden Canyon, both in the Salt Lake area.
In the 2006-2007 winter season, Utah had seven injury-causing avalanches. At least 10 people were hurt in locations ranging from Ogden to the Uintas to Salt Lake City. Utah also had five injury-causing avalanches in the previous winter season and nine the year before.
Avalanche experts recommend that skiers, snowmobilers and snowboarders learn about the dangers of slides before hitting the slopes. They also recommend carrying safety gear such as beacons, probes, shovels and a lightweight backpack. Most avalanche victims have only 15 minutes to live after being buried in snow, according to the avalanche center."

 ","","","The Human Factor:
The group of six fit a certain profile: highly athletic, young, aggressive riders with boarding skills that far outweigh their avalanche skills.  Only one had taken any sort of avalanche class, and none were wearing or carrying any rescue gear.  Interviews with most of them led me to conclude that none of them had called the avalanche hotline or looked at the Utah Avalanche  Center’s website that day.  One had a brother who had suffered massive injuries and been life-flighted from the Snowbasin backcountry from an avalanche incident a couple years before.  

Epilogue:  
I went in to do the investigation with the help of some Brighton ski patrollers, who promptly had the access gate into the area closed to skier traffic until we were out ‘down and clear’.  Not more than a couple hours after we were gone, two other large avalanches were triggered in the area that completely engulfed the terrain in which we’d been.

After lunch, they rode up Crest lift and hiked out the Pioneer gate.  The three had not called the Utah Avalanche Center forecast, but noted the posted UAC danger rating of  ”MODERATE” as they left the gate. They were not carrying their beacons or shovels.  They followed the boot track up to the top of sub peak 10,321.  As they dropped into the initially low angle terrain, they dug a quick hand pit.  As the terrain steepened, all three regrouped above a steeper break over.  The first person dropped in 5 or 6 turns, when he heard a yell.  The slope broke out under them all three of them.  The lower person shot out right to some trees, getting out of the slide.  The left most person was caught and carried as he attempted to move left.  After a short distance, he was able to jam his snowboard against a clump of trees, and let the slide go by.  The middle person went for the full ride, approximately 400 vertical feet. 
When the two boarders on top realized their partner was missing, they made a quick plan.  One called Brighton Resort for help, and then started searching the upper section of the slide path, checking out any piles of debris.  The other focused on the lower debris, where he saw an odd shaped lump, then the hat of the 3rd person, and some movement.  The victim had one hand partially free, and was attempting to clear his face, which was partially buried.  He was in a semi prone position, face up, head up hill near the surface, and feet, with board still attached about 4 feet deep.  His two companions dug him out, and kept him warm until rescue came.  He was sledded to Brighton base, taken by ambulance to the hospital, and released later that night.","","","The three boarders have some snowpack, terrain, and avalanche knowledge, but just did not quite put the pieces together that day.  They owned beacons and shovels, had practiced with their beacons, but did not take them that day.  They had attended several avalanche awareness talks.  They dug a quick hand pit just off the ridgeline, but the location and/or depth did not give them the information they needed.  They also had a plan of stopping at the steeper rollover, and descending the slope one at a time, but misjudged the terrain.  However, when the accident did occur, their response was ideal – one person was able to get off the slab, another stopped using trees. They then rapidly organized and performed an effective self rescue, getting their partner out alive.  With this near miss having a good outcome, it could be considered a good learning experience.","","",""

They spent the early part of the day skiing in the area.  As the day wore on and the in area powder got skied up they were looking for more untracked snow.  When they heard that the No Name area would be opening they were one of the first groups to access this terrain.  The group hiked to the peak of No Name, and from there they stopped briefly, Miles mentioned seeing very few tracks into the “in area” ski terrain, but they decided to continue to the backcountry access point leading into Hell’s Canyon.  Miles had previously skied Snowbasin, and in the past had skied in the Hell’s Canyon area which is adjacent to No Name and is backcountry not controlled not patrolled terrain.  He reported that the previous season he had spent a good part of the day skiing in Hell’s Canyon and had a very good time.  Miles mentioned that the group passed the “are you beeping” sign at the top of the Mt. Allen tram, this sign is a reminder to those that will be leaving the ski area to have the proper rescue equipment and to be thinking about potential avalanche hazards.  The group also saw the forest service warning sign at the backcountry entrance and the signs posting the ski area boundary.  Miles did say that leaving the ski area did not seem to be a big concern.  He was looking for some good powder skiing and from past experience figured Hell’s Canyon was a good place to get it.  Standing at the entrance to Hell’s they saw a group of two skiers skiing a ridgeline that separates Hell’s Canyon from Cold Water Canyon, other than that there were no other visible tracks.  Once in the Hell’s Canyon area the group had one more discussion.  Miles mentioned to the group that it was best to avoid going to far skiers left as that could put them in a different drainage that would not allow them to get back to the resort.  There was no discussion of avalanches, other possible risks, or of travel protocols while traveling in this terrain.  John McDevitt later did report feeling uncomfortable about getting into this terrain but did not voice his concerns to the group at this time.  Miles skied the first open shot at the entrance and then the others followed.  Miles reported that the skiing was good at the start, but as the terrain got steeper there was extensive sloughing of the new snow.  He stopped part way down the area he was skiing as he was starting to feel uncomfortable.  He also noticed a sizable avalanche off to his left.  His friends were above him, and they were also apprehensive and had not skied as far into this terrain.  John with some early apprehension was off to the skiers right closer to the ski area boundary, and the other two were in the center of the terrain above Miles.  At this point the whole group could still communicate and were still in visual contact.  Miles called up that he did not feel good about this terrain and wanted to get out by skiing to his right back to the ski resort.  They all agreed that this was a good idea.  The three skiers that were up higher in the terrain were all able to ski to the right and traverse back to the resort.  They then skied along the boundary back to the bottom of the ski resort.  On their way down they did pass a ski patroller who was doing some work on the boundary, they did not mention to him anything about their situation.  Miles who was lower in the terrain was blocked by a rocky spine and had to ski down farther into the terrain to find a way to traverse out.  Because of his drop in elevation he was separated from the group and they lost contact with him.  He eventually found a way to get across this rocky spine.  As he was coming into the next gully he passed under a steep pitch of snow.  He said that when he came into this area he could see the slope crack and the fracture start to open up.  His first thought was that he could maybe ski off of this slab by gaining some speed, but he was immediately pitched forward.  He then tried to grab the bed surface to avoid going with the slab, this also did not work.  Soon after beginning to be taken with the slide he hit a tree and tried briefly to hold on to that, but the force of the slide pulled him off and he was now in an uncontrolled ride with the avalanche.  He was spun around traveling head first, he fought to stay on the surface of the slide but spent most of the ride under the snow.  He did report occasionally poking through but was immediately pulled back down.  He did feel the snow starting to slow down and at the same time could feel the snow starting to become denser.  He had the feeling that he had one last chance to get to the surface because if he didn’t the increasing density of the snow would not allow any movement at all.  When the snow came to a stop he was tightly buried up to his eyes with his left hand sticking out.

Rescue Summary:  With his left hand he was able to clear the snow to his mouth,  at this point he realized that he still could not breath and probably had not had an airway for some time because his mouth was stuffed full of snow not allowing him to breath.  He was able to force this snow out of his mouth and clear his airway.  He then proceeded to unbury himself.  He came out of this ride with no major injuries.  He later noticed some soreness of the ribs from hitting the tree, but with the adrenaline of the event the only noticeable sign of discomfort was his throat being sore from the snow that was forced into his mouth.   He had lost all of his ski equipment and his ski hat, but he was able to move so he then proceeded to walk out.  Peter Francis an off duty ski patroller was in the area and was able to find out that Miles was not hurt.  Peter then phoned into ski patrol dispatch that there was an individual walking out of Hells Canyon with no equipment and that he had been in an avalanche.  As Miles was beginning to walk out, Paul Wright and Chad skied up to him.  Paul stayed with Miles and assisted him to patrol.  Paul also reported to patrol dispatch that Miles had been skiing with three other people and at that their whereabouts were unknown.  Chad exited Hell’s ahead of the group so that he could report his findings to ski patrol.  He was met at the bottom of Hell’s Canyon and taken to patrol.  No Name terrain was closed by the ski patrol and the patrol was put on stand by as there were still 3 individuals in the group not accounted for.  Paul eventually walked Miles out of the Hells area and he was taken to ski patrol.  By the time Miles arrived at ski patrol his friends had been located and also directed to ski patrol.","","","Skiing and riding in the Hells Canyon area adjacent to Snowbasin is a very common practice.  This terrain is easily accessed via a short walk to No Name peak.  This terrain is very popular because it provides the adventure of backcountry skiing with very easy access back to the Snowbasin ski area.  This terrain is very steep tree skiing with numerous narrow gullies.  The Canyon faces east with steep shots from the north, east, and south all dropping into the drainage at the bottom.  All of the slide paths converge at the bottom of this drainage making it a very dangerous place to be with any type of avalanche danger.  This group did not really consider the differences between skiing in the ski area where avalanche control has been done, and the very different uncontrolled terrain that is just the other side of the boundary.  The close proximity and easy access to backcountry terrain in that area easily lures people into a sense of complacency in dealing with avalanches.  This group very quickly got themselves into trouble by entering backcountry terrain.  Miles commented that the in area terrain of Snowbasin was nearly untracked, but the lure of powder beyond the boundary was very attractive.  Because this group was in a resort skiing mindset, they went into this terrain casually.  Miles was partly deciding on where to ski from previous experience in this terrain which was positive and very rewarding.  But any venture into backcountry terrain should be approached carefully with the proper avalanche travel and rescue equipment.  Safety decisions dealing with travel and terrain are now up to the individuals and the full scope of decision making skills needs to come into play.  Weather, current condition of the snowpack, and travel considerations for the given terrain all need to be discussed with the group.  It is important to have good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are getting into, and knows what the plan is.  This group did eventually realize that they were getting into dangerous terrain with dangerous conditions.  And they made the right decision to not continue.  By not having good travel techniques and a good plan from the start they got separated and Miles was left alone.   When he was caught in the slide no one in the group was aware of his situation.  If it were not for the luck of every thing lining up just right for him this could have very easily had a very tragic ending.  As Miles said “things unraveled very quickly once we left the ski area boundary.  I was very fortunate the way that things turned out.  No matter how euphoric the powder skiing is you still have to use your brain.”  During the slide he had to miss all of the trees and rocks that fill the gully that he slid down.  Then he had to get his hand out of the snow because as he admitted the density of the snow when it stopped may not have allowed him to move at all.  With no one aware of his situation he is very lucky to have had things turn out as well as they did.

Raymond area.  According to reports, the victim, seeking more challenging terrain, left his two partners at the Gobblers/Raymond divide and continued to the summit of Gobbler’s Knob with the plan to meet back at the trailhead within the hour.  After waiting at the car for some time, the remaining two called 911 to initiate a search.  A helicopter with personnel using night vision goggles verified tracks going into an avalanche high on the peak with none coming out.  The body recovery efforts by both Salt Lake Country Search and Rescue and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue began the following morning. The three Norwegians were all wearing rescue gear and had called the avalanche forecast that morning.  The Utah Avalanche Center had rated the danger as  “CONSIDERABLE on slopes steeper than about 35 degrees facing northwest through northeast through southeast, where dangerous avalanches 1 to 3 feet deep can be triggered by people.”  The forecaster, weary of the three previous fatalities that week, implored people to “Back off the steep stuff – if the close calls continue, someone else is going to get killed or hurt.”  
The winds were too strong for a helicopter evacuation so members from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, Wasatch Powderbird Guides, and the Salt Lake County Sheriff brought the body down Butler Fork to the Big Cottonwood highway.  This was a very demanding task of bringing the body down this drainage not to mention just getting him off of the steep slope where he was found.

Events leading up to the accident:
A father and his two sons were skiing at Snowbasin resort.  Later in the day, they headed out-of-bounds into the Hell’s Canyon area, an area north of Snowbasin where avalanche hazard is not mitigated with explosives, nor patrolled.  Their objective was to ski powder.  The group had little or no avalanche training and had no rescue gear.  While descending, the sons skied ahead of their father and got separated.  The details are not clear, but a slide was triggered and Brian Schwartz the seventeen year-old son was caught in the slide.  Brian was swept approximately 1500 vertical feet down the slope and was buried.  He had significant trauma to his face and head and appeared to have died of trauma.   Brian’s father and other bother arrived at the site some time after the slide had happened.  They found one of Brian’s skis and continued to look for him around the area.  Soon afterwards two snowboarders arrived and saw what had happened.  They also found a helmet and liner below the toe of the debris.  They immediately came to dispatch to report the incident.  The father and brother were also brought to dispatch shortly after.

Rescue:
Ski Patrol dispatched an initial response task force.  This was made up of two teams; the first team came in from above; 3 pros and one dog.  A second team came in from below via snowmobile and foot; two pros and a dog.  The first team arrived and searched the pile with beacons, Reccos, dog and spot probing.  The second team arrived and also searched with dog and spot probing.  After the initial search came up negative a first column was dispatched from the top.  This included 4 pros with avalanche rescue gear.  When the first column arrived a probe line was started.  After probing for nearly an hour a strike was made and Brian’s body was recovered approximately 6 feet under.  Although he appeared dead rescue efforts were taken until a life flight helicopter could host the body back to the base of Snowbasin.  All patrollers returned to the based area without further incident.

Most of them were wearing avalanche rescue gear, though those details are still being sifted through. Many clues to instability were missed along the way, including natural avalanches close to the accident site. In addition, at least one large hard slab avalanche was triggered without incident, about a ¼ mile north of the accident site prior to the fatality. This slide was 2’-3’ deep, 250’ wide, running about 150’ vertically. It most likely emboldened the group, luring them deeper into the avalanche dragons den. This group was very familiar with the terrain and had triggered small avalanches in the area on past outings.
Around 16:00 the group traveled to the southwest of the avalanche they just triggered and regrouped at the bottom of a south facing slope. Several riders climbed the 32 degree slope above them without incident. Sixteen year old Zachary Holmes began climbing the slope too, but when he neared the top, he began “side-hilling” towards a steeper adjacent slope which had more of an easterly aspect. As he changed aspect and slope angle, he triggered a large hard slab avalanche 2’-4’ deep and 300’-325’ wide.
His partners turned their beacons on to receive and began searching. There was plenty of confusion and several random holes were dug 75’ uphill from where Zachary was finally located, buried 3’ under his snowmobile which was sticking out of the snow. After he was found, two young men stayed on the scene and began CPR while a male and female rode back to the trailhead to make a cell phone call and alert local authorities. Much to their dismay their phones didn’t work at the trailhead, but a family with an “OnStar” system in the vehicle placed a call and Wasatch County Search and Rescue was dispatched.

The accident happened in a popular snowmobiling area of rolling hills with short, slopes.  The victim was highmarking a slope when he triggered the avalanche.  Since there were trees at the bottom, he could not outrun the avalanche.  He was not wearing a beacon.  He was with two other snowmobilers during the day.  They were separated at the time of the accident.  The two others did not think anything about the fact that they were separated, they just figured Michael took a different route.  They returned to an area where Micheal should have shown up.  When he didn’t, they knew something was wrong.

Rescue:

Both the victim and his snowmobile were completely buried.  Companions at the scene called for a rescue, but before rescuers could arrive, they randomly dug the search area, which was fairly small—70 x 30 feet.  They found his snowmobile and while digging it out, they found the victim’s hand.  He was buried sitting up with his head 2-3 feet deep and his hand was reaching upward.  The victim did not respond to CPR.","","","","","",""

Three skiers left the town of Alta Tuesday for a ski tour into Big Cottonwood Canyon.  They ascended the south facing slope above the town of Alta.  They decided to ski down into the West Bowl of Silver Fork.  This was an east northeast facing slope.  When they regrouped, it was decided to ascend the more northerly facing slope to regain the ridge.  As they were ascending, the slope fractured and avalanched.  All three were caught.  One grabbed a tree and was not carried far but did lose a ski.  Another was carried around 30 feet and was buried enough so that he was not able to move without digging himself out.  The third was missing.
 
Rescue Summary:
After determining that one person was missing from the party, the other two initiated a search with avalanche transceivers.  They were aided by another nearby solo skier.  The location of the missing person was quickly located between 100 and 200 feet downhill from where he was caught and they struck him with the first attempt with an avalanche probe.  He was reportedly buried around 4’ deep.  When they uncovered him, he was face down.  They checked his airway for snow but it was already clear.  They noticed that he was breathing but it was labored.  They started to treat for hypothermia by placing the victim on top of backpacks and putting on spare layers of clothing.  Rescuers were contacted via a cell phone and a life flight helicopter was dispatched.  The victims labored breathing improved and he became coherent.  He was able to ski himself down around 200 feet to where the helicopter was able to land.  He was then evacuated.","","","All of the skiers involved had some formal avalanche training but two of them had more training then the buried victim.  They chose the West Bowl of Silver Fork because of its low angle options which would be appropriate for the conditions that day.  They performed some snow stability tests on the way up from Alta.  They noted some weakness within the new snow.  They were also aware of faceted snow near the ground on northerly facing slopes.  They did not experience any cracking or collapsing and successfully skied one run.  This is when things started to go wrong.  They decided to walk up a northerly facing slope to regain the ridge and then walk east on the ridge.  It appears this deviated from the original plan of sticking to low angle terrain.  Perhaps since they successfully skied the run and did not see any cracking, collapsing, or other avalanches, this influenced their decision.  Excitement about the new ski season could have also played a role.  At least one member of the party had reservations about some of the decisions but did not speak up.  Later when the group discussed the accident, the other two had reservations as well but there was not complete communication.  This fits into the “no leader” category where no one is in charge of making sure complete communication is occurring.  Many accidents occur due to communication problems and no one is immune to making similar mistakes.  It should be noted that this was a text book example of a perfect rescue which was accomplished only because the touring party had the proper rescue gear and was trained in using it.","This is above where the skiers were caught.

Two snowboarders decided to leave the Brighton ski resort afternoon on Monday.  They rode the Crest lift then exited through the ski area boundary gate and hiked up the ridge heading toward Pioneer  Peak.  Once they were near the intended ski decent, one of them had a large cornice break underneath him which in turn triggered a sizeable avalanche that swept him down the slope.  He was carried over a sizeable section of rocks.  The time was approximately 1:30 pm. 
Rescue Summary:
The victim’s partner quickly started down an adjacent slope and made a quick search of the debris pile.  Neither of them had any avalanche rescue gear with them.  After he was unable to locate his friend he returned to Brighton to summon the ski patrol.  At 1:55 pm ski patrol dispatched the initial search party along with the witness.  One of the ski patrols located a hand sticking out of the debris pile and they made the recovery at 2:21.  The victim was buried about 1 ½ feet deep.  Resuscitation efforts were applied and a Life Flight helicopter was sent to the accident sight where the victim was loaded and flown to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.  An autopsy revealed he died form blunt force injuries to the torso but also showed signs of asphyxia.  The injuries were serious enough that he probably wouldn’t have survived despite the signs he may have been breathing when he came to a stop.","","","The witness was very shaken up and realizes the many mistakes that they made resulted in a tragic ending.  Often accidents are cumulative mistakes compounded.  One of the common themes is they were very familiar with the backcountry terrain outside of the ski resort.  Many people forget that these adjacent backcountry areas are not part of the ski resort and do not receive any avalanche control work from the ski resorts.  After frequenting these areas many times they can start to feel like just another part of the ski resort.
 
The snowboarders did own avalanche rescue gear and practiced with it.  They did not carry it that day because they had no intention of leaving the ski resort.  They didn’t call the avalanche forecast that morning but did read the brief forecast that the ski patrol posts from the Utah Avalanche  Center at the backcountry gates.  They were expert snowboarders but their avalanche skills were not as high.  They did note some recent avalanche activity while walking the ridge but were unaware of how sensitive the newer cornices were.  The cornice that broke already had foot tracks from other backcountry travelers that were walking around on it earlier in the day.  This may have given the victim a false sense of security.","Ski patrol can be seen standing at the victims location.","","This is looking up from where the victim was found"

We still have not talked directly to the witness so we are missing some information on the accident.  What we do know is that two people left the Snowbasin ski area Saturday, March 11th and headed into Taylor  Canyon.  Both of them were snowboarding and neither of them had avalanche rescue equipment.  At around 3 pm one or both of them triggered an avalanche that caught one of them and buried him.  It broke about 15’ above them.  The person that was not caught searched for about an hour starting in some trees just down the slope from the fracture line which was the last place he saw the victim.  The witness continued down the avalanche path with no luck locating the victim then continued out the drainage into Ogden where he alerted authorities.  A helicopter was dispatched to survey the area and avalanche workers were able to locate the avalanche along with a few others that had run as well.  Time was too short late in the day to dispatch an initial response team so the search was called off until morning.  
Rescue Summary:
Efforts were organized early Sunday morning but weather did not permit a snow safety team to do control work on slopes that had the potential to avalanche onto the area where the search party would be.  Lees and Kobernik along with G.R. of the Snowbasin patrol attempted to travel to the fracture line.  Unstable snow and very radical terrain kept them from doing this safely so the mission was aborted.  Some clearing was taking place by late Sunday and avalanche control work was performed.  Explosives did produce avalanching that covered the initial debris pile.  The initial search party was dispatched but unable to locate the victim.  The Weber County Sheriff had closed the Taylor Canyon access from Snowbasin until the search is done so that potential skiers above the rescue party don’t put them in danger.  On Sunday the witness was questioned by the search teams and it was determined to conduct a search in the trees near the starting zone which was the last place the victim was seen.  This was not done the night before because lack of time.  Dogs immediately picked up the scent and the victim was found about 150’ below the fracture line where he was hung up on a tree.  It appears he was slammed into a tree and died of trauma.","","","A copy of the Utah Avalanche Center’s daily advisory is regularly posted at the access gate to Taylor  Canyon.  That day it warned of fresh wind slabs and not to be surprised if you trigger an avalanche.  It is not known at this time if the victims consulted the advisory.  Many people consider backcountry terrain adjacent to ski resorts to be an extension of the ski resort with the same dangers as within the area boundary.  Often, they ski in this terrain regularly and take for granted that the snowpack receives no avalanche control work and does not see the same amount of skier compaction as within the ski area.  Since they are familiar with this terrain, it is difficult for them to pass it up when there is fresh snow to ski.  However, this terrain has a backcountry snowpack where new weakness and persistent weakness can exist even though it is so close to the resort.","","",""

Body found may be missing snowshoer 

NATALIE EVANS - Daily Herald     

Utah County searchers believe they have found the body of missing snowshoer Marshall Higgins.

A search-and-rescue plane passing over the Primrose Cirque area on Mount Timpanogos Friday reported seeing clothing partially buried in the snow. The clothing items are consistent with those reportedly worn by Higgins, though no positive identification of the body has been made. 

Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Dennis Harris said a search-and-rescue plane has been flying over the area every three days, weather permitting, since an avalanche on Dec. 31, 2005, buried Higgins, 31, of Salt Lake City. 

After spotting the clothing, search and rescue efforts were organized for Friday afternoon. Harris said the body was three to four miles away from the Aspen Grove area.

When searchers arrived at the body, they used ice picks and shovels to dig a hole 12 feet in circumference and 7 feet deep through three layers of ice, according to a Utah County press release. 

They reported that each layer of ice was 2-6 inches deep. 

Before searchers could take the body down the mountain, a thunderstorm suspended the search, the release stated. They decided to spend the night on the mountain with the body, which was fitted for transport on a stokes litter. 

The body is ready for Life Flight, and searchers hope the helicopter will be able to take the body off the mountain today, the release said. 

Searchers have been looking for Higgins since the avalanche. Searches days after the incident had to be called off because of weather and potential avalanche danger to rescuers. 

Searches organized in the spring were called off because of too much snow in the area, though searchers have hiked through the area looking for Higgins since the snow started melting. 

They have not identified the body yet, but there are no other missing persons reported to be in the area, Harris said.

Salt Lake man presumed dead in avalanche 

Search suspended: A Salt Lake City man is presumed dead, but a missing teen is found near Snowbird 

By Jason Bergreen 

The Salt Lake Tribune

Salt Lake Tribune  

ASPEN GROVE - Just before Marshall Higgins headed out for a snowshoeing excursion into the high mountains east of Provo, Jeff Frederick took a photo of his friend in the pre-dawn darkness of Aspen Grove. 

On Sunday, that photo was tacked to the inside wall of a Utah County sheriff's mobile command center as helicopters waited to get to the mountainside where Higgins had been swept away in an avalanche on Saturday. By midafternoon, authorities told Higgins' family that the search had been deemed a search and recovery, not a search and rescue. A short time later, weather and snow conditions forced temporary cancellation of the search. 

Earlier, Higgins' brother Adam Higgins, said the family was aware that change in the status of the search meant Higgins likely had died. ""It was disheartening but expected,"" he said. ''We're so grateful Jeff came out of it.'' 

Higgins, 31, and Frederick, both of Salt Lake City, had hiked for more than five hours to an altitude of about 10,300 feet near Hidden Lakes when the slide engulfed them. Frederick was able to ride it out, clutching a tree to stop. He searched for his friend, then used his cell phone to call for help. A Utah Department of Safety helicopter plucked him to safety at about 4:30 p.m. Saturday. 

Also on Sunday, a 16-year-old California boy who had gone missing in an out-of-bounds area of Snowbird ski resort was found alive and in good condition at about 11:20 a.m. 

Snowbird spokeswoman Laura Schaffer said the boy built a snow cave in Mineral Basin, in the north fork of American Fork Canyon, and emerged at about 10 a.m. Sunday and flagged down a search helicopter. 

""He was a smart kid, and the clear weather today, those were the saving graces in this situation,"" she said. The boy's parents declined to release their and their son's names and hometown, she said. 

In the search for Higgins on Sunday, Wasatch Powderbird Guides dropped 29 explosive charges to knock loose any potential avalanches before search crews were to be flown in. But shifting winds and intermittent cloud cover forced authorities to call off the search, and Utah County Sheriff James Tracy said forecasts of another storm system meant it would not resume today. 

Tracy said weather and conditions would determine when the search would continue. 

Higgins' brothers described him as a sociable guy who made friends easily. An experienced snowshoer and outdoorsman, he had ventured into the area several times in years past, his brother Brandon Higgins said. This was his first foray there this winter; Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Darren Gilbert said Saturday neither man had an avalanche beacon on this trip. 

Frederick declined to speak to reporters Sunday at Aspen Grove. 

Higgins is survived by his wife, Kelly, and daughters Hannah, 3, and 2-year-old Emilee. 

His presumed death is the first this season. By this time last year, four people had died in avalanches, and a total of eight would perish, making that season one of the deadliest since records have been kept. 

Saturday's avalanche was near where three men died on Dec. 26, 2003. They were among a group of five who were swept down as they snowboarded in the Roberts Horn Chute of Aspen Grove, about 2 1/2 miles north of Sundance Ski Resort. 

The California boy apparently slipped through two rope barriers at about 1:30 p.m. Saturday to get to the out-of-bounds backcountry, Snowbird's Schaffer said Sunday. He was reported missing about 4 p.m., and the ski patrol and dogs searched for him until 11:30 p.m., when conditions were deemed too unsafe, Schaffer said. 

During that time, the boy carved out a snow cave for refuge, she said, adding that he had heard snowcats about 100 yards away at about 10 p.m. that night but was ""too tired"" to flag them down. The boy slept in the cave through the night, awakening at 10 a.m. Sunday to the sound of a helicopter. He waved to it and was rescued about 90 minutes later. 

The boy and his parents had been skiing and boarding, but when he went missing he was with some cousins, Schaffer said. 

Salt Lake County sheriff's Sgt. Todd Griffiths said the boy would not be penalized for leaving the resort's boundaries. ''He basically got lost, went off a small hill and got in an area where he felt he could not hike out,'' he said. 

In all, the ski patrol, Wasatch Powerbird Guides and representatives of five counties - Salt Lake, Weber, Utah, Davis and Wasatch, contributed to the two searches.

Four skiers were caught in a large avalanche on Saturday, December 3rd, 2005.  The skiers had decided to go to No Name Bowl on J’s recommendation.  They were looking for good powder skiing.  The group had skied two runs successfully and returned to the top.  At around 12:45 pm they then traversed farther out to the north to ski where there were still fresh tracks.  J, R, and JN skied the slope and regrouped where they thought they were clear of the slide path.  RR was two or three turns into the bowl when it fractured.  He went for a ride as the 600’ wide avalanche started down hill.  It overtook the other three skiers and all luckily only ended up partially buried or mostly buried.

Rescue Summary:
Two of the victims were buried deep enough that they were not able to dig themselves out.  The other two were able to deg themselves out then help dig out the rest.  They regrouped by about 1:00 pm to decide how to evacuate the area as they had lost most of their gear including skis, poles, and some of their clothing such as gloves, etc.  They then called for help and were evacuated by helicopter by 4:45 pm.","","","All of the skiers had near 30 years of backcountry skiing experience each except J who still had around 10 years experience.  When RR was interviewed, he said that they were aware of the weak snow near the ground and that No Name Bowl was prone to avalanching.  Group dynamics played the biggest role in this accident as the lure of fresh powder and having fun with friends overrode their avalanche hazard decision making.  This is a common theme when experienced backcountry travelers get caught.","","",""

On Thursday March 31st a group of five snowmobilers left the Monte Cristo trailhead, located near Ogden,  Utah, for a day of snowmobiling. The terrain is relatively benign and is an area many locals go to when there is an avalanche danger on nearby steep, climbing hills. The group was very familiar with the terrain and was thinking about the avalanche conditions, and they were all wearing beacons, shovels, and probes.  Four of the riders stopped on top of a slope just to the south of “Whiskey Hill”. The fifth sledder and avalanche victim passed by them, and much to everyone’s surprise began descending a steep adjacent slope to the south, named Eccles Peak. 
The snowmobiler was only about 20’ onto the slope when he propagated a large avalanche.

One of the members of the party drove to the top of the slope, got off his machine and ran down the bed surface while the rest of the party approached from the bottom of the slope. Within a matter of minutes the fellow descending the slope pinpointed the victim in a tight group of trees and within 7 or 8 minutes the party had the victim dug out.

                                                       Images by Toby Weed from 4/1/2005
 
  
                            
Tragically, a 27 year-old snowmobiler from Farr West died after triggering this avalanche on the last day of March.  He is the 8th person to die in an avalanche in the Utah backcountry this season.
 
 
                          
The deadly avalanche occurred on a steep wind-drifted slope just south of the slope known as ""Whiskey Hill.""  ""Whiskey Hill"" is on Eccles Peak off the snow-covered Curtis Creek Road, and because hwy 39 is closed in the winter, it is accessible for snowmobilers from either Monte Cristo trail-head (west side near Huntsville and east side near Woodruff). 
 
 
                           
       The slope that avalanched is just a little steeper than Whiskey Hill, (the tracked slope on the right or to the north).  It faces just a little more north, it's shallower and it may have picked up a bit more wind-deposited snow. 
 
            
 
                          
The hard slab avalanche was over 500 feet wide and averaged 4  feet deep at the crown.  The short slope is very steep ( 38 to 45 degrees  in slope steepness).
Utah Avalanche Center forecaster, Craig Gordon, has to kick his boot toes into the solid bed-surface in route to the crown.
      
             
 
                        
            The  northeast facing slope at just under 9000' in elevation is a classic avalanche  trap.    Prevailing winds drift tons of snow from a large open  flat area to the west of the slope and deposit it here as they decelerate.   It is  a perfect lee-slope fetch area.
 
 
 
                       
 To make matters worse, snow sliding off this slope runs smack into, and then strains through a wall of mature conifers.  The unlucky snowmobiler probably died from massive trauma inflicted by the trees as he was pushed through them by the avalanche.
 
 
                      
      Craig Gordon examines the mechanical properties of the avalanche by digging above the crown.  Up there he can test snow that is undisturbed by the avalanche.  It's important for us to look at avalanches.  We compare what we find in the crown profile of the avalanche path to the snow profiles of slopes in the region that haven't avalanched.  Is there a similar combination of a stiff slab and a thin sugary weak layer?  If so, we must suspect that other human triggered avalanches are possible.
 
 
                       
The stiff wind-deposited slab failed on a thin sugary or faceted layer capped  by a dirty wind-crust in early March.  The rest of the solid slab consists of snow  deposited in the last 2 big March storms (3/20-2/23 and 3/28-3/30).
 
              
                       
  The cornice above shows us that wind deposited snow builds up on the slope below.  Prevailing winds scour snow off an expansive flat open ridge-top and can rapidly deposit tons of snow onto this steep northeast facing slope.
 
                      
              A single track descending into the middle of the avalanche tells the story.  A snowmobiler rode past his party and down the steep slope.  The avalanche released when he was about 20' into it, right at a steep rocky roll-over where the remaining snow is shallow and weak.  The track enters the slide path in the center, and the slab pulled out a couple hundred feet on either side.
 
                      
             He might have been able to ride out the avalanche if it were on an open slope, but instead he was driven into an unforgiving grove.   These trees are directly in the fall-line below the tracks leading into the avalanche.
 
 
                     
     Tons of snow strained through the trees and piled up deeply around them.  This is looking up at the crown from near the burial site.
 
 
 
                      
             Here is the burial site in a large pile of snow on the downhill side of these trees.  Given the situation, the rider was found quickly by his party who were all equipped with beacons, probes and shovels.  Even so, he died, most likely as a result of trauma.  Statistics show that at least a quarter (or 25%) of avalanche fatalities can be blamed on trauma.  Many die before the avalanche even stops.

A group of five out-of-state snowboarders went to the Canyons Resort for the day and they rode to the top of the Peak 9990.  They saw the nearby slopes of Dutch Draw with several dozen ski and snowboard tracks in it and noticed several other parties hiking into the area.  Although most of the party members had beacons and shovels in their cars, they did not bring them that day because they did not plan to go into the backcountry.  Two of the party members had taken a level I avalanche class. The party knew about the avalanche danger because they discussed it at length the previous night.  They decided to go into the backcountry that day because it looked like a number of other people were doing it without incident.
They hiked the 200 yards to the top of Peak 9990 and left from the backcountry access gate, which is clearly marked with several signs warning of the danger.  To leave the boundary, one must push open a gate with a large, white sign attached showing a skull and crossbones marked in large letters “You May Die”.  It is legal to access the backcountry, which National Forest, but the Canyons Resorts wants to make sure everyone knows that there is no avalanche control beyond their rope lines.  They hiked south along the ridge about a half mile to the top of Dutch Draw.  On the way, they passed one avalanche path that had dozens of tracks in it and they went to the next path locally known as “Conehead” because of its shape from a distance.  They hiked to the high point, which had only a few tracks in it and decided that it was too dangerous and they backtracked to an area where the slope angle is gentler and they could utilize an island of thick conifer trees to safely get down into the upper third of the slope.
They descended through the island of trees and they planned to enter the slope from the side by passing beneath a vertical cliff band.  One snowboarderentered the slope below the cliff and Shane Maixner, 27, decided to jump off the lower portion of the cliff onto the slope—a drop of about 20 feet.  He appeared to trigger the avalanche when he landed and he was engulfed in the slide.  The first snowboarder managed to escape off the nearby flank of the avalanche.
	
Rescue Summary:
The group of snowboarders descended the avalanche bed surface and began probing with tree branches for their friend.  They also called 911 on their cell phone and ski patrol from the Canyons Resort responded within about 20 minutes.  After rescuers determined that the party did not have beacons and that they did not get any beacon signals from the rest of the debris, they decided that conditions were too dangerous to put a larger group of rescuers onto the slope.  They escorted the remaining four snowboarders out of the area and Wasatch Powderbird Guides dropped explosives onto the upper part of the avalanche path.  They triggered the next slope to the north with another large, hard slab avalanche, which was not quite as large as the original slide, but they did not trigger any hangfire above the original avalanche.   
The Summit County Sheriff took over the rescue and brought in a larger team from the Summit County Search and Rescue along with personnel from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue.  They used avalanche rescue dogs and probes.  They finally found the body of Shane Maixner two days after the accident, buried four feet deep in a grove of trees on the extreme north edge of the avalanche path.   
It proved very difficult to know how many people were caught in the slide because of widely conflicting witness accounts.  The original party of snowboarders reported that they believed that they were alone in the bowl.  They did not notice any one else.  Three other parties, however, reported other people in the bowl.  First, a party at the top of the slope was video taping the scenery from the ridge when they heard the roar of the avalanche.  When they looked over the edge and continued to video the slide.  The tape, reportedly, was of poor quality and inconclusive about other parties in the bowl.  Second, two snowboarders were building jumps on the flats below just to the north of the avalanche runout and they were adamant that they saw others on the slope and were able to give descriptions of clothing and exact locations.  Third, a party hiking up to the backcountry access point from the top of the 9990 lift claimed to see a lone skier going across the flats at the bottom, who was overcome by the slide.
Since many of the people who ski at the Canyons Resort are on vacation, it was very difficult to know who was missing at the end of the day.  In fact, it took until January 17th—three days after the accident, to whittle the list down.  The Summit County Sheriff announced that there was likely only one fatality and he called off the search. 
Media interest was intense because the some witnesses to the avalanche initially indicated that there may have been 15 people buried.  On the heels of the large mudslides in California, the national media arrived in droves and it became headline news across the country and the lead story in many of the television news programs for the next several days.","","","CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS

				PARK CITY - An exhausting four-day search for victims of a massive avalanche near The Canyons ski resort is over. Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds said Shane Maixner, 27, who was found Sunday beneath 4 feet of snow, is probably the only person who perished.
					   Investigators have whittled a list of overdue or missing people to three, but Edmunds said he is doubtful they were caught in the avalanche, which Maixner is believed to have triggered.
					   Searchers began scouring the steep slope just after 1 p.m. Friday without knowing how many people they were looking for, although they believed as many as five were caught in the avalanche, according to eyewitness accounts.
					   As of Monday, however, there was no compelling evidence to suggest there were more victims, the sheriff said.
					   Witness accounts of what happened may have been ""clouded"" by the fear they experienced as they watched the disaster unfold, he said.
					   ""They all saw something different, and this is not atypical of a situation like this.""
					   Edmunds said the search ""could ramp back up if we get further information.""
					   Maixner's death brought Utah's 2004-05 avalanche season fatality total to seven, the most since 1950, when officials began tracking avalanche deaths.
					   While searchers uncovered pieces of clothing not belonging to Maixner, they believe the scattered, miscellaneous items may have been left there over time, by other skiers.
					   The number of searchers probing the 30-foot deep avalanche Monday was about a third the size of the crew that assembled Saturday. They navigated through bulky, debris-littered terrain in dangerous avalanche conditions, and by late Monday were fatigued, Edmunds said.
					   At the top of the Ninety Nine 90 Express ski lift Monday, which opened to the public for the first time since the avalanche occurred, skiers and snowboarders gawked at the devastation from behind a temporarily erected rope boundary. Ski patrol members explained to the curious onlookers that their presence on the mountain could trigger additional slides, putting the searchers' lives in peril.
					   By dusk Monday, only a few Red Cross workers lingered at the command center at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Park City to stack up chairs and break down tables
					   ""This has been a huge ordeal,"" Edmunds said. ""There have been a lot of people who have helped us through this.""
					   The tab for the search, which is in the tens of thousands of dollars, will be jointly paid for by Summit County and the state, the sheriff said.
					   An accident report issued Monday by the U.S. Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center says there was some initial agreement that a snowboarder ""launched over a cliff, triggering the massive slide that engulfed him and an unknown number of others that were either on the same slope or in the runout below.""
					   Though the report does not mention Maixner by name, it says the snowboarder's body was recovered Sunday.
					   Rescue dogs alerted searchers to the Sandpoint, Idaho, man's body, which was found with goggles, a snowboard and a helmet.
					   The ""hard-slab avalanche"" broke up to 6 to 8 feet deep and 700 feet wide, the report states, and was composed of hard and dense new snow, wind-deposited new snow and a weak layer of snow formed during November's dry spell.
					   Edmunds said skiing out of bounds at ski resorts, which is what Maixner did, is a class B misdemeanor in Summit County. About a dozen people are arrested every year for the violation.
					   He would not speculate on whether Maixner would have been arrested had he survived the run and been observed by deputies.
					   ""One of the things we like to do, and continue to do,"" Edmunds said, ""is reiterate how dangerous the backcountry is.""

            Two men died in avalanches in Sanpete   County on Saturday, the latest   victims of what has become an unusually dangerous season in Utah's backcountry.
                Garrett Luke Gordan of Ephraim was snowboarding at about 1   p.m. when he was swept up in an avalanche near the top of Ephraim Canyon,   said Andy Lyon, a Sanpete County Sheriff's Office sergeant. 
                Gordan, who was carrying an avalanche beacon, was buried   for about a half hour before friends dug him out. They administered CPR until   Sanpete County searchers arrived and called in   a Life Flight helicopter. The 26-year-old was flown to Utah   Valley Regional   Medical Center   in Provo   where he was pronounced dead.
                An hour later, a snowmobiler was buried in an avalanche   east of Mount Pleasant in the Choke Cherry   Ridge area, Lyon said. David Wayne Johnson,   42, of South Jordan, was dug out by searchers and flown to Sanpete Valley    Hospital where he was   pronounced dead.
                Craig Gordon, an avalanche forecaster at the U.S. Forest   Service Utah Avalanche Center, said this winter is shaping up to be an   unusual - and deadly - season for avalanches. Six people have perished in   slides so far this winter, equaling the death toll of 2000-2001, according to   Avalanche Center records. 
                ""This is an unusual weather pattern, and unusual   weather tends to produce unusual avalanches,"" Gordon said. A steady   stream of storms in the region have brought high winds, heavy snowfall and   fluctuating temperatures - ""the perfect recipe for a slab   avalanche,"" he said.
                On Saturday, the mountains were blasted with winds up to   100 mph and between 6 and 8 inches of snow was forecast that night, said   Bruce Tremper, director of the Avalanche    Center. 
                ""It's kind of a 'triple whammy,' as we call it,""   he said. ""We get snow, dense and heavy, extremely strong winds and   warming temperatures. People without good avalanche skills should definitely   avoid the backcountry.""
                Avalanche danger continues to be high for all Utah mountains, even   for low-elevation terrain, Tremper said. 
               While snow, rain and wind pelted other parts of Utah, Saturday in the Salt Lake    Valley was sunny and   dry. Though strong southerly winds whipped through parts of Salt Lake City on Friday night and   Saturday, the majority of a large West Coast storm wasn't expected to produce   snow in the valley until after midnight.
               ""The main storm itself is somewhat stationary along   the West Coast,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Tardy said.
               Several inches of snow fell Saturday afternoon in Logan,   Price and Heber, Tardy said. Alta Ski Resort has received about 18 inches of   new snow since Friday, 6 of which fell Saturday, he said. 
               Winds gusting 30 to 40 mph were recorded in Salt Lake    County, with some gusts   reaching as high as 49 mph at the airport, Tardy said. High winds reaching up   to 90 mph continued blowing in areas of the Wasatch Mountains.
               Snow in Salt Lake     City could turn to light rain today with   temperatures reaching the mid 40s. More rain was expected Monday, with snow   returning to the valley Tuesday, Tardy said.

Avalanches Kill Two in Central Utah
Jan. 8, 2005 
Sam Penrod reporting 
Another deadly weekend in Utah's   backcountry, as two avalanches kill two people in Central    Utah. The slides both happened in Sanpete County Saturday   afternoon, about an hour apart. 
It's been a tragic day in Sanpete County.   Two men were killed in separate slides, while snowboarding and snowmobiling   this afternoon. 
In the mountains east of Mt. Pleasant,   a group of snowmobilers were in the area, when one of them apparently   triggered an avalanche, around 2:00 this afternoon. One person was buried in   the slide, but those in the group eventually were able to dig the victim out.   But he could not be revived. 
Saturday evening, volunteers from the Sanpete County Search and   Rescue were able to recover the victim from the avalanche. 
Sheriff Kay Larsen/ Sanpete County Sheriff's Office: ""There   was approximately ten people up there snowmobiling together. They had lost   sight of him and could see the tracks where it had slid, and went down there.   [They were] able to get him out of the snow, but unable to revive him."" 
About an hour before the Mt.   Pleasant slide, a 26 year old man   who was snowboarding got caught in an avalanche in Ephraim Canyon.   The victim was buried in the slide, but was wearing an avalanche beacon and   someone who was with him was able to dig him out and started CPR. 
The victim was airlifted to Utah Valley    Medical Center   where he died. 
Tonight authorities are identifying the victim as 26 year old   Louk Gordon from Ephraim. And in the Mt.   Pleasant slide, 42 year old David   Wayne Johnson of South Jordan was killed. 
Authorities say heavy snow earlier in the week and then the   warmer temperatures today likely caused both slides. 
Avalanche Warning 
Those fatalities make five avalanche-related deaths in the last   month. 
Another smaller avalanche-- about 4-feet deep-- has closed the   road up Little Cottonwood Canyon. Authorities are telling everyone to get   out. An avalanche warning is in effect for ALL Utah mountains, and that warning will   remain in effect for the rest of the weekend.

A group of five out-of-bounds skiers from Snowbasin Ski Area (Preston, Brad, Allen, Tanner, & Jeremy), left the ski area boundary and went into Hell’s Canyon, a very steep, rugged, and uncontrolled area just north of Snowbasin Ski Area.  They triggered an avalanche, 100 feet wide, one foot deep, that carried Allen, Preston, Jeremy and Brad.  Allen was able to ski onto a sub ridge and get behind a tree.  Preston, Jeremy and Brad go for a ride down a narrow chute named ""Lust"" which is about 1500 vertical feet into the gully below.  The starting zone was 42 degrees.  It partially buried Jeremy, Preston, and Brad who was able to extricate himself.  Preston  had what appeared to be serious injuries.  After Brad dug himself out he partially digs out Jeremy then Preston.  At 9:57 a.m. Jeremy calls 911.  Allen and Tanner wait approximately 5 to 10 minutes and then descend.  On their way down, Tanner was caught by another small slide and was able to grab a tree after being carried 15 feet.  A random ski in the debris hit him.  When Tanner and Allen arrive at the burial site, Brad and Jeremy are working on digging out Preston.  All of them dig by hand trading off two pairs of gloves as all the other gloves were lost in the slide.  At this point, Jeremy is in contact with Snowbasin Dispatch via cell phone.  At about 10:30 a.m. Tanner spots a powder cloud coming down an adjacent chute named ""Gluttony"".  This slide was triggered by another party from above.  All four of them grab Preston and drag him out of the path and begind a small sub-ridge just as the third slide comes by, burying their previous location with another 6 feet of depostion.  Tanner then leaves the group and goes to dispatch.  The debris from all of the slides was 30-40 feet wide, up to 20 feet deep, and filled the gully at least 600 feet in distance.  All of the terrain in the area funnels into the same runout zone (the gully).
 
Rescue Summary:
None of the party had rescue gear (such as beacons, shovels and probes) so they were very lucky to not be completely buried.  Ski patrollers from Snowbasin Ski Area responded to the accident and called in a medical helicopter, which airlifted Preston to the hospital. The rescuers also found the random ski that hit Tanner, which did not seem to belong to any of the victims, so they performed a beacon search on the debris along with avalanche rescue dogs and did a course probe of the area.  Since it was a very dangerous area for additional avalanches, they decided to pull all the rescuers out of the area and see if anyone turned up missing.  If so, they would perform avalanche control on the hanging hazard and send in a larger rescue crew.","","","CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS","","","Media Reports

Skiers cause slide 
Five ignore warnings, survive avalanche behind Snowbasin 
Sun, Jan 2, 2005 
By JANAE FRANCIS
Standard-Examiner staff
jfrancis@standard.net
SNOWBASIN -- Five skiers were lucky to make their way out of the backcountry behind Snowbasin Ski Area Saturday after two of them triggered an avalanche and all of them were swept up in the moving snow.
Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Merv Taylor said two groups were skiing at 10 a.m. in the area called Hell's Canyon, which is out of bounds behind Snowbasin, when the avalanche occurred.
The five skiers involved in Saturday's avalanche are all believed to be Davis  County residents. The two groups were not skiing together, Taylor said.
The two skiers who triggered the avalanche received injuries that needed treatment.
One was taken by helicopter to LDS Hospital to treat a broken femur. The other person received an injury to the arm.
Recovery operations continued throughout the day even after these skiers were found to be safe because searchers found an extra ski for which no one had an accounting.
Search dogs were flown into the area by helicopter and all possible resources from Snowbasin were called in, Taylor said, to search for a possible skier buried under the snow.
No signs of another skier were found before the search was called off in the late afternoon.
Taylor said all of the skiers had skied to the area despite warnings of avalanche danger at the resort. Such warnings also were published in area newspapers and broadcast on local television stations.
""We've had a lot of good weather, a foot of new snow. We've had heat, cold and wind,"" Taylor said. ""The avalanche potential was high, and they were out of bounds.""
Taylor hopes the incident will remind people to stay out of the backcountry. ""It's too dangerous,"" he said.
A statement issued by avalanche forecasters for the U.S. Forest Service said that several days of strong winds and snowfall have created considerable to high avalanche risk, especially for steep slopes with recent wind drifts.
The warning was centered around backcountry areas that do not receive grooming by ski areas.
Alex Tardy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service/Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, said large quantities of snowfall, windfall that causes areas to load up with snow, different snow types and changes in temperatures combine to create conditions in which avalanches are more likely to occur.
He said in the past three or four days, higher elevations along the Wasatch Front have experienced 2 to 4 feet of snow. ""It's not a day to really do backcountry skiing,"" he said. ""It's a Catch-22 because the conditions really are tempting.""

            A Davis County man was airlifted to LDS   Hospital on Saturday morning after an   avalanche partly buried him in Hells Canyon   near the Snowbasin Ski Resort.
               It was one of seven slides since Friday along the Wasatch   Front, where days of heavy snow have raised the danger level and prompted a   warning from the U.S. Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center.
               Preston Neiderhauser, 26, was   downhill skiing from the peak    of John Paul with four   other people when they triggered an avalanche in the out-of-bounds area at   about 9:45 a.m. The avalanche plowed into Neiderhauser,   who survived with cuts and bruises, and swept up two other skiers who were   not seriously injured.
               ""It was an unreal experience,"" Neiderhauser said in a telephone interview from his   hospital room. ""I was very aware and coherent as I was knocked down. . .   . I definitely had the thought, 'It would be a miracle if I survived.' ""
               He said he knew to swim in an avalanche, and he tried to   keep his mouth uncovered. When the slide stopped, the other skiers found Neiderhauser, who was not carrying an avalanche beacon or   shovel, and dug him the rest of the way out. 
               A helicopter landed at the site - about a half mile from   the Snowbasin parking lot - and took Neiderhauser to LDS Hospital, then returned to ferry in Snowbasin searchers and three dogs, said Weber County   sheriff's Lt. Merv Taylor.
               A single ski found at the site had prompted concern that   someone might be buried in the avalanche. The search team scoured the area   until about 4 p.m. but found nothing. The team waited for the ski resort   parking lot to empty out and made sure no cars were left. If one had been   left, a search would have been launched today.
               After the first avalanche, a pair of skiers triggered two   more in Hells Canyon, but no one was hurt, Taylor said.
               The U.S. Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center had issued a   New Year's Day avalanche warning for the mountains in extreme southeast Idaho and northern Utah.
               On New Year's Eve, backcountry skiers triggered four   avalanches in the Ogden area mountains,   according to the Avalanche    Center's Web site. No   one was injured, but one person was carried about 100 feet.
               Heavy snowfall and high winds throughout the week have   created ""considerable"" to ""high"" avalanche danger in the   northern Utah mountains, the Avalanche Center reports. Those without good   backcountry avalanche skills are advised to avoid avalanche terrain.
               The conditions are similar to those last month when four   people were killed in avalanches over two days.
               Bruce Quint, 59, Melvin Denis,   32, and Troy Tolbert, 42, were killed Dec. 11. Quint   and Denis were backcountry skiing in Big   Cottonwood Canyon   when they were buried, and Tolbert was snowmobiling in the Trout Creek area   near Strawberry Reservoir in Wasatch    County.
               One day before, Zachary Eastman, 23, also died while   backcountry skiing in Big    Cottonwood Canyon.

               Avalanche danger
               
                Winter storm conditions will continue to create avalanche   danger in the Wasatch backcountry. Today's National Weather Service forecast   calls for a 50 percent chance of snow in the afternoon, with highs in the   uppers 30s and low 40s. Monday is forecast to be breezy and cloudy, with a 50   percent chance of snow and highs around 40 degrees.
               Avalanche safety tips
               
                The USDA Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center Web site at   http://www.avalanche.org/~uac/ contains a wealth of information about   avalanches. Here are some tips culled from that site:
               
               Backcountry travel tips
               
               l Venture onto slopes one at a time, leaving someone in a   safe spot to do the rescue. Split large groups and stay in visual and voice   contact. 
               
               l Plan an escape route. What will   you do if you trigger an avalanche?
               
               l Use slope cuts. Keep up your   speed and cut across the starting zone, so that if you do trigger an   avalanche, momentum can carry you off the moving slab into safer terrain.
               
               l Watch for cornices and give them   a wide berth. Never walk to the edge of a drop-off without first checking it   out.
               
               l Look for alternatives: Follow   ridges, thick trees and slopes with safer consequences. You can almost always   go back the way you came. 
               
               l If there's no other choice, go   underground. You can almost always weather a bad storm or bad avalanche   conditions by digging a snow cave in a protected area. You may be   uncomfortable, but you will be alive. 
               
               Coping with an avalanche
               
               l If you trigger an avalanche, try to get off the slab. If   you are on skis or a snowboard, try heading straight downhill to build speed,   then angle off to the side of the moving slab. If you're close enough to the   crown, you can try running uphill to get off the slab, or running off to the   side. If you're ascending when the avalanche breaks, there's not much you can   do.
               
               l If you're on a snowmobile you   have the advantage of power. Grab some throttle and if you're headed uphill,   continue uphill. If you're headed across the slope, continue to the side to   safe snow. If you're headed downhill, your only hope is to try to outrun the   avalanche. Remember that large avalanches travel 60 to 80 mph and are   difficult to outrun.
               
               l If you can't escape the slab,   try grabbing a tree. But do it fast; avalanches   quickly pick up speed.
               
               l If you can't escape the slab or   grab a tree, swim hard. A human body is about three times more   dense than avalanche debris and tends to sink unless it's swimming   hard.
               
               l As the avalanche finally slows   and just before it comes to rest, try to clear an air space in front of your   mouth. This helps delay the buildup of carbon dioxide, which allows you to   live longer under the snow. 
               
               l Push a hand upward. Visual clues   allow your friends to find you faster. You may not know which way is up, but   take your best guess.
               
               l After the avalanche comes to a   stop, the debris will instantly set up like concrete. Unless you are very   near the surface or have a hand sticking up out of the snow, it's almost   impossible to dig yourself out of an avalanche."

Mountain mayhem 
Slides injure one, claim 2nd victim in 2 days 
By Brady Snyder and Jennifer Dobner
Deseret Morning News 
The lasting image Trace Workman has of his friend Ben Dejong is one of Dejong moving as fast as he could down a mountainside with a massive avalanche barreling down on him.

But 20 tons of snow move much faster than human legs can, and the 27-year-old from Bountiful was overtaken.
""I saw Ben, and he was running as fast as he can,"" Workman said. ""It was like an ocean wave when it comes in, and it just engulfed him. There was this big powder cloud, and as soon as that settled I couldn't see nothing. I couldn't see one sign of him.""
For the next 20 to 25 minutes Saturday morning Workman led a frantic rescue effort that included mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and ended with Dejong's life being saved.
Dejong was lucky, and his rescue served as a joyous highlight in an otherwise dangerous and deadly few days.
Snowslides in Utah's backcountry engulfed at least four people and killed two in the past two days in Salt Lake, Wasatch and Davis counties. Two snowshoers are missing. 

    Dejong was caught while snowmobiling with Workman high in Farmington Canyon      above Davis County. 
    The victim of an avalanche Friday above Brighton and Solitude in Big Cottonwood      Canyon was identified Saturday as      Zachary Eastman, 23, Salt Lake        City. A friend escaped. 
    A snowmobiler was killed by an      avalanche Saturday near Strawberry Reservoir. His identity has not yet      been released. 
    And two snowshoers were missing late      Saturday in the Mineral Fork area of Big      Cottonwood Canyon,      where a Salt       Lake County      search and rescue effort there may have been hampered by slides.

State helicopter pilots assisting with the Mineral Fork search from the air reported ""one major and one minor avalanche in the area,"" Salt Lake County Lt. Mike Wardle said.
The men, one aged 60 and one 32, were reported missing about 5:45 p.m. when they failed to return at the expected time, he said.
Because Mineral Fork is a high-risk area for avalanches — and because the avalanche danger has been so high in recent days — the search for the men was expected to be halted around midnight and resumed at first light, Wardle said.

Extreme danger
""All of these slides that have been breaking out have been 3 to 8 feet deep and very difficult to survive,"" said Bruce Tremper, director of the Utah  Avalanche Center.
Avalanche forecasts over the past few days warned would-be backcountry recreationalists of the extreme danger and high potential for slides, especially on or below steep slopes.
""We've had all the important ingredients for an avalanche. We've had a quadruple whammy,"" Tremper said. ""A weak layer of snow is one; a whole bunch of new snow, number two; wind, number three; and rapid temperature rises.""
The avalanche-risk assessment, however, was dropped from ""high"" to ""considerable"" as snow conditions began to stabilize Saturday, Tremper said.
Strawberry tragedy
Despite those improving conditions, a 42-year-old man was killed near Trout Creek in Wasatch County's Strawberry Valley Saturday. The man, whose name was not released, was snowmobiling with a friend when his vehicle became stuck on a steep slope, Wasatch County Sheriff's deputy Corey Davis said.
The avalanche was reported about 11:30 a.m., Davis said, and measured about 500 feet long and 300 feet wide. It broke above the man and buried him in roughly 4 feet of snow. His companion was not caught in the slide, and with the help of another recreationalist, who was carrying an avalanche beacon, the pair was able to locate the man — who was wearing a beacon — and dig him out, Davis said.
The two called 911 from a cell phone. Investigators were still trying to determine how long the man was buried. A medical helicopter transported the man to a Utah County hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Davis said.
Twin  Lakes Pass
Friday afternoon, Eastman was killed near Twin Lakes Pass near the Brighton and Solitude ski areas in Big Cottonwood  Canyon. These are the second and third avalanche deaths in Utah in 2004. A snowshoer died in a Deer Valley slide in February.
""He was a free spirit, and (skiing) is what he lived for, that was his love,"" Eastman's father, Scott Eastman, said Saturday. ""That's the only thing that's giving me a little peace in this.""
Zachary Eastman and a friend had skied the area all day Friday, and both were trained in avalanche safety, his father said. As early as last week, the pair had been to a refresher course on using avalanche beacons, he said.
But sometimes with Mother Nature ""you just don't know which way it's going to go,"" Scott Eastman said.
Farmington Canyon
Dejong might have suffered a similar fate in Davis County.
Workman of Clinton and Dejong regularly frequent the backcountry of Farmington Canyon, snowmobiling below Bountiful Peak. Workman figures they visited the canyon 20 times last year, and with a few feet of fresh snow, Saturday seemed the ideal time to hit the powder again.
""They just love riding up in Farmington Canyon,"" Trace's father, Mark, explained. ""They're these extreme riders.""
It was Trace who apparently triggered the slide, which Davis County Sheriff's Capt. Kenny Payne described as ""very large.""
It was about 9 a.m. when Dejong was using a video camera to film some of his friend's moves in a lofty chute.
Then the mountain caved in.
""I climbed out of the chute and that whole mountainside came down,"" Workman said. ""I looked down, and it was like the whole mountain went out from beneath me.""
Down the hill Dejong desperately tried to start his snowmobile, but the engine wouldn't crank. With a dead motor, the Bountiful man turned and ran, only to be swept up in the powder.
Workman sped down the hill and began desperately searching for his friend. Fortunately, Dejong was wearing an avalanche beacon that allowed Workman to locate the area where his buddy was buried.
Workman dug with his hands for a couple of minutes before being joined by Corey Malan of Ogden.
""We just started digging frantically,"" Malan said.
The rescue
The pair located Dejong's boot about 5 feet below the surface when Malan's two friends caught up with a shovel.
In a painstakingly slow five to eight minutes the foursome uncovered more leg, a knee, a thigh, a torso and finally Dejong's head, which was buried face down.
""At that point it was pretty dark,"" Workman said. ""He was purple and blue and was pretty discolored. At one time I thought he was dead. I thought it was too late.""
The rescuers said there was just a faint hint of breath coming from Dejong's mouth, and Workman offered some mouth to mouth that seemed to help.
The group had already used a cell phone to call for a medical helicopter, and as they waited Dejong lay unconscious for 10 to 12 minutes.
When the helicopter appeared over the mountain, Dejong suddenly sprang to life.
""The first thing out of his mouth was, 'I just can't believe you guys found me,' "" Malan said.
Payne said Dejong was airlifted to University  Hospital as a precaution. He had no broken bones or obvious injuries, Payne said.
It was a rescue effort that turned out much better than one Malan participated in back in 1996 when another friend, Rick Adams, was killed by a massive slide in Farmington Canyon. Searchers didn't find Adams' body for over a month.
'A life saver'
The difference was Adams' lack of an avalanche beacon, which issues a transmission that allows rescuers to pinpoint where a person in buried in the powder.
In Dejong's case, his beacon saved his life, police and rescuers said.
""It's a life saver,"" Malan said. ""I won't go up without one.""
Of course, a beacon does not give people a license to cheat death.
Eastman, the Salt Lake man killed Friday, was also wearing a beacon, but rescuers couldn't revive him despite using CPR.
Avalanche forecasters stressed that much of the new snow that blanketed the Wasatch Front mountains last week had not meshed with old snow, creating a great slide danger. Compounding the problem were sunshine and high temperatures, making the snow even less stable.
""That snow had not bonded underneath. Boy, there are avalanches all along those hills,"" Malan said. ""There were at least six or seven in the next four bowls over. It's really bad up there right now. I told everyone I've seen going up there not to go.""
Tremper said avalanche forecasters did allow an avalanche warning to expire Saturday morning, but he said conditions, with high temperatures and new snow, remain perilous.

            Avalanches along the northern Utah mountains Friday night and Saturday   killed two people and nearly snuffed out the life of a third man, equaling   half of the total deaths recorded all of last season.
               The latest fatality occurred around 11:30 a.m. Saturday in Wasatch County   when a 42-year-old man snowmobiling in the Trout Creek area of Strawberry Valley was buried in 4 feet of snow.   The victim was wearing an avalanche beacon but witnesses were unable to   locate him for about an hour, the Wasatch Sheriff's Office reported. 
                The man, whom police did not identify, was flown to Utah Valley    Regional Medical    Center, where he was   pronounced dead.
                On Friday night, an Avalanche near Grizzly Gulch claimed   the life of 22-year-old Zachary Eastman of Salt Lake    County. Eastman was   trapped under 2 to 3 feet of snow for about five   minutes after triggering the avalanche while skiing across a backcountry   slope. 
                The Forest Service Utah   Avalanche Center   had issued an avalanche warning for the northern Utah   mountains and extreme southeast Idaho   earlier Friday. That warning was downgraded from ""high"" on Friday   to ""considerable"" Saturday.
               ""There were only a few avalanches Saturday, but they   were triggered by people and they were very large,"" Utah Avalanche    Center director Bruce   Tremper said. ""The avalanche activity that occurred two days ago has   greatly diminished.""
               Recent snow, strong winds and rapidly warming temperatures   contributed to the high avalanche danger, with avalanches occurring at unusually   low elevations, according to the Forest Service's Web site.
               A 27-year-old Bountiful   man trapped in an avalanche Saturday is lucky to be alive.
               Through the camcorder's tiny lens, Ben Dejong   watched his buddy, Trance Workman, power his snowmobile up the face of Bountiful Peak. He then heard a crack and saw a   wall of snow rushing toward him.
               The sunshine filling the Farmington Flats area of Farmington Canyon Saturday quickly turned to   shadow as the avalanche sped toward Dejong.
               Suddenly the size of the slide doubled, than tripled, and   then appeared to cover the whole side of the mountain.
               The power and force behind the quickly disintegrating   mountain appeared less dangerous through Dejong's   camera's lens than he could fathom. In an instant, a wave of fear rushed over   him and he began running.
               ""I thought, 'I'm not going to make it,' "" Dejong said, recounting the ordeal from his home Saturday   afternoon.
               The rushing snow, he said, sounded, ""just like the   wind.""
               Dejong took three steps, turned   to grab his own snowmobile and was immediately crushed by the ocean of snow.   The impact sent Dejong spinning head over heels   down 10 feet of the mountain. He was smashed into darkness 4 feet under the   snow before coming to a stop. He was alive and conscious thanks only to a   small air pocket between his lips and the snow.
               ""I was buried stiff and I couldn't move an inch,""   Dejong said. ""I said, 'That's it, you know I'm   gone.' I said my goodbyes in my head, then I did   some screaming.""
               Dejong remained alert for about 5   minutes before blacking out.
               ""I've never felt so trapped like that,"" he said.   ""It was 5 billion times worse than I could have imagined.""
               The next thing Dejong remembers   is being awakened by Workman pounding on his chest.
               ""I thought I had slept in and was being wakened   up,"" Dejong said.
               Since becoming workmates at Central Davis Sewage and   friends more than six years ago, Dejong and Workman   had ridden in this backcountry area more than 100 times. 
               The injury inflicted on Bountiful Peak   by Workman's snowmobile triggered the avalanche, he said. Workman sat stunned   on the ridge as the avalanche bore down on his friend.
               ""I was gasping for air,"" he said. ""I   couldn't fathom it, it was so big. The whole mountain cracked underneath me.   There was no snow left.""
               Within seconds, Workman was racing to rescue Dejong.
               ""I saw him go up in the air,"" Workman said.   ""It looked like he jumped and tried to swim.""
               The avalanche covering Dejong   measured 200 feet wide, 8 feet deep and had traveled about a quarter of a   mile down the face of the mountain.
               When he reached the area where Dejong   had disappeared, Workman began searching for his missing friend with a avalanche beacon. As the sound got louder, he noticed a   ski from Dejong's snowmobile sticking out of the   snow. The shovel the men had brought had been washed away in the avalanche.   Workman had to use his hands.
               ""I was just digging as fast as I could,"" he said.   
               Minutes later, another snowmobiler   arrived with a shovel and began helping.
               After digging for several minutes, the pair came upon a   boot. Then they saw Dejong's shaved head.
               ""He was found face down, unconscious and blue,""   Davis County Sheriff's Capt. Kenny Payne said.
               ""I'd thought I'd be attending a funeral,"" said   Workman, who immediately began CPR.
               Luckily, Dejong began breathing   on his own, though only slightly. Workman yelled at him to wake up.
               ""What about the girls? What about your wife? What   about the girls? What about your wife?"" he kept repeating.
               Dejong answered by opening his   eyes.
               He was transported by helicopter to University Hospital.   He was released around 2:30 p.m., suffering only from bumps and bruises he   got when his snowmobile hit him.
               At home recuperating Saturday with his wife and two   daughters, Dejong reflected on his good fortune.   ""I'm lucky beyond my years,"" he said.

Two snowshoers were reported as overdue when they failed to return from a walk up Mineral Fork on Saturday, December 11th.  Victim are Bruce Quint, 59, and Melvin Dennis, 37, both from Salt Lake City.  
	
Rescue Summary:
Saturday night, two skiers from Salt Lake Country Search and Rescue followed snowshoe tracks to the base of a large headwall at the upper end of Mineral Fork where the tracks disappear under fresh avalanche debris and did not appear again on the other side.  The two snowshoers were the first people to travel up Mineral Fork after the large storm, which ended two days earlier.  Searchers could find no beacon signals in the debris, nor visual clues.  Neither of the victims wore beacons.  In consultation with several avalanche experts, including one who flew over the area in a helicopter that night, they decided that conditions were too dangerous to bring in a larger team of searchers that night. 
On Sunday morning personnel from Wasatch Powderbird Guides controlled the area with explosives, which triggered widespread avalanches in remainder of the canyon as well as hang fire above the accident site.  They flew teams of rescuers to the site including Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue, Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, a volunteer group of ski area personnel operating under the Salt Lake County Sheriff.  The helicopter was from Utah Highway Patrol.  They searched the area using trained avalanche rescue dogs and probed areas where the dogs indicated interest.  At 11:30, they found Melvin Dennis buried about four feet deep and more-or-less in line with the tracks which entered the debris.  They found the second victim Bruce Quint, on Monday, December 13, 2004 around 10:00 am about 25 yards uphill from the first victim and buried over eight feet deep.  Both victims appeared to have been simply pushed over by the debris and buried without being tumbled and were probably buried fairly near their initial positions.","","","PHOTOS:  See Photos.

Two males had been snowmobiling in the upper Trout Creek drainage. They decided to go to a slope very familiar to them. At around 11:30 they arrived at the base of the slope. They decided the more experienced of the two, who was wearing a beacon and did have a shovel, would attempt to climb the slope first. About mid way up, he got his machine stuck. He worked on it for a while, got hot and took off his helmet. While he was trying to get unstuck his partner, who had no rescue gear, climbed an adjacent slope. His intention was to get high enough on the slope in order to ride down to the stuck machine and assist in the excavation. As the witness got to the top of a bench he saw the crown start to propagate on the same slope the victim was on. The witness realized a large avalanche had been triggered. He circled back around to find no sign of the victim.
Rescue Summary:
The witness rode his machine to a nearby ridge and called 911. He also flagged down 3 or 4 riders to help him with the search. They followed him back and began probing likely areas with broken branches. The witness then jumped back on his machine and climbed another ridge and flagged down two riders who had beacons, shovels, and probes. They returned to the scene and found the victim within 5-7 minutes after their arrival using their beacons.  It took another 7-10 minutes to dig him out. He was buried about 4’ deep, face up, not breathing and CPR was initiated. His machine was buried as well and later located about 60’ downhill.","","","Click HERE for photos.

Slide victim was skilled and careful

Something in her mother's intuition had told Tami Eastman that a day like Friday might come.

""I always knew I would lose Zachary to these mountains, I just didn't know which one,"" Tami Eastman said, one day after Zachary Eastman died in an avalanche in Big Cottonwood  Canyon. ""He had a love of the mountains and a love of the Wasatch.""
Zachary, 23, was skiing with a friend in the Twin Lake Pass area between and above the Brighton and Solitude resorts when an avalanche broke loose above him at about 5 p.m.
He was the first of two people to die in avalanches along the Wasatch Front in the past two days. In addition, two snowshoers were missing late Saturday.
""Zach was in the lead; his friend was in the safe zone,"" the young man's father, Scott Eastman, said, recounting the story Zach's companion told about what happened on the mountain. ""Zach crossed into open space and went to the other side. He said the snow felt sketchy, (so Zach) turned and started to come back . . . and then it just happened.""
Both young men were experienced skiers who had frequented that part of the backcountry, Scott Eastman said. Zachary Eastman had trained in avalanche safety and spent some time working as a volunteer for the National Ski Patrol in the Park City area last year. And as early as last week, both men were honing their skills with avalanche beacons, Scott Eastman said.
""The one thing that's kind of helping me is that they did everything right,"" Scott Eastman said. ""From what I know of the whole scenario, they followed all the protocols and did things right.""
That includes the ""textbook rescue"" attempt Zach Eastman's companion attempted, Scott Eastman said.
Zach's friend, whose name has not been released, located Zach, dug him out of the snow and began CPR, pausing only to call 911 for help. A medical helicopter lifted Zach Eastman out of the canyon and to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
""The poor kid feels really badly, guilty, but he did everything right,"" Scott Eastman said again.
A provisional report of the incident from the Utah Avalanche Center posted Saturday night indicates that the slide in which Eastman died was between 1 and 3 feet deep and about 200 feet wide.
Eastman was traversing a 35-degree, northeast-facing slope, and the snow fractured about 80 feet above him, according to the report written by avalanche forecaster Drew Hardesty.
Zachary Eastman's parents said they can find some comfort in knowing their son died doing the thing he loved in the place he loved. Winter or summer, Zachary, who was studying nursing at Salt Lake  Community College, was in the mountains. 
""It was his passion,"" Tami Eastman said. ""He would start (on) Timpanogos and climb all of those mountains. He would take his Ramen noodles and his water purifier and be gone for days.""
Losing Zach to the mountains is somehow easier than losing him to a traffic accident caused by a drunken driver or in another sort of accident, his mother added.
""He was a very sweet boy, and I was privileged to be his mama on this earth,"" she said.
In keeping with his desire to help others and his career aspirations, Zachary Eastman was an organ donor, Tami Eastman added, so his empathy for others will be evidenced, even in his death.

Mountain mayhem 
Slides injure one, claim 2nd victim in 2 days 
By Brady Snyder and Jennifer Dobner
Deseret Morning News 
The lasting image Trace Workman has of his friend Ben Dejong is one of Dejong moving as fast as he could down a mountainside with a massive avalanche barreling down on him.

But 20 tons of snow move much faster than human legs can, and the 27-year-old from Bountiful was overtaken.
""I saw Ben, and he was running as fast as he can,"" Workman said. ""It was like an ocean wave when it comes in, and it just engulfed him. There was this big powder cloud, and as soon as that settled I couldn't see nothing. I couldn't see one sign of him.""
For the next 20 to 25 minutes Saturday morning Workman led a frantic rescue effort that included mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and ended with Dejong's life being saved.
Dejong was lucky, and his rescue served as a joyous highlight in an otherwise dangerous and deadly few days.
Snowslides in Utah's backcountry engulfed at least four people and killed two in the past two days in Salt Lake, Wasatch and Davis counties. Two snowshoers are missing. 
Dejong was caught while snowmobiling with Workman high in Farmington Canyon      above Davis County. 
    The victim of an avalanche Friday above Brighton and Solitude in Big Cottonwood      Canyon was identified Saturday as      Zachary Eastman, 23, Salt Lake        City. A friend escaped. 
    A snowmobiler was killed by an      avalanche Saturday near Strawberry Reservoir. His identity has not yet      been released. 
    And two snowshoers were missing late      Saturday in the Mineral Fork area of Big      Cottonwood Canyon,      where a Salt       Lake County      search and rescue effort there may have been hampered by slides.
State helicopter pilots assisting with the Mineral Fork search from the air reported ""one major and one minor avalanche in the area,"" Salt Lake County Lt. Mike Wardle said.
The men, one aged 60 and one 32, were reported missing about 5:45 p.m. when they failed to return at the expected time, he said.
Because Mineral Fork is a high-risk area for avalanches — and because the avalanche danger has been so high in recent days — the search for the men was expected to be halted around midnight and resumed at first light, Wardle said.

Extreme danger
""All of these slides that have been breaking out have been 3 to 8 feet deep and very difficult to survive,"" said Bruce Tremper, director of the Utah  Avalanche Center.
Avalanche forecasts over the past few days warned would-be backcountry recreationalists of the extreme danger and high potential for slides, especially on or below steep slopes.
""We've had all the important ingredients for an avalanche. We've had a quadruple whammy,"" Tremper said. ""A weak layer of snow is one; a whole bunch of new snow, number two; wind, number three; and rapid temperature rises.""
The avalanche-risk assessment, however, was dropped from ""high"" to ""considerable"" as snow conditions began to stabilize Saturday, Tremper said.
Strawberry tragedy
Despite those improving conditions, a 42-year-old man was killed near Trout Creek in Wasatch County's Strawberry Valley Saturday. The man, whose name was not released, was snowmobiling with a friend when his vehicle became stuck on a steep slope, Wasatch County Sheriff's deputy Corey Davis said.
The avalanche was reported about 11:30 a.m., Davis said, and measured about 500 feet long and 300 feet wide. It broke above the man and buried him in roughly 4 feet of snow. His companion was not caught in the slide, and with the help of another recreationalist, who was carrying an avalanche beacon, the pair was able to locate the man — who was wearing a beacon — and dig him out, Davis said.
The two called 911 from a cell phone. Investigators were still trying to determine how long the man was buried. A medical helicopter transported the man to a Utah County hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Davis said.
Twin  Lakes Pass
Friday afternoon, Eastman was killed near Twin Lakes Pass near the Brighton and Solitude ski areas in Big Cottonwood  Canyon. These are the second and third avalanche deaths in Utah in 2004. A snowshoer died in a Deer Valley slide in February.
""He was a free spirit, and (skiing) is what he lived for, that was his love,"" Eastman's father, Scott Eastman, said Saturday. ""That's the only thing that's giving me a little peace in this.""
Zachary Eastman and a friend had skied the area all day Friday, and both were trained in avalanche safety, his father said. As early as last week, the pair had been to a refresher course on using avalanche beacons, he said.
But sometimes with Mother Nature ""you just don't know which way it's going to go,"" Scott Eastman said.
Farmington Canyon
Dejong might have suffered a similar fate in Davis County.
Workman of Clinton and Dejong regularly frequent the backcountry of Farmington Canyon, snowmobiling below Bountiful Peak. Workman figures they visited the canyon 20 times last year, and with a few feet of fresh snow, Saturday seemed the ideal time to hit the powder again.
""They just love riding up in Farmington Canyon,"" Trace's father, Mark, explained. ""They're these extreme riders.""
It was Trace who apparently triggered the slide, which Davis County Sheriff's Capt. Kenny Payne described as ""very large.""
It was about 9 a.m. when Dejong was using a video camera to film some of his friend's moves in a lofty chute.
Then the mountain caved in.
""I climbed out of the chute and that whole mountainside came down,"" Workman said. ""I looked down, and it was like the whole mountain went out from beneath me.""
Down the hill Dejong desperately tried to start his snowmobile, but the engine wouldn't crank. With a dead motor, the Bountiful man turned and ran, only to be swept up in the powder.
Workman sped down the hill and began desperately searching for his friend. Fortunately, Dejong was wearing an avalanche beacon that allowed Workman to locate the area where his buddy was buried.
Workman dug with his hands for a couple of minutes before being joined by Corey Malan of Ogden.
""We just started digging frantically,"" Malan said.
The rescue
The pair located Dejong's boot about 5 feet below the surface when Malan's two friends caught up with a shovel.
In a painstakingly slow five to eight minutes the foursome uncovered more leg, a knee, a thigh, a torso and finally Dejong's head, which was buried face down.
""At that point it was pretty dark,"" Workman said. ""He was purple and blue and was pretty discolored. At one time I thought he was dead. I thought it was too late.""
The rescuers said there was just a faint hint of breath coming from Dejong's mouth, and Workman offered some mouth to mouth that seemed to help.
The group had already used a cell phone to call for a medical helicopter, and as they waited Dejong lay unconscious for 10 to 12 minutes.
When the helicopter appeared over the mountain, Dejong suddenly sprang to life.
""The first thing out of his mouth was, 'I just can't believe you guys found me,' "" Malan said.
Payne said Dejong was airlifted to University  Hospital as a precaution. He had no broken bones or obvious injuries, Payne said.
It was a rescue effort that turned out much better than one Malan participated in back in 1996 when another friend, Rick Adams, was killed by a massive slide in Farmington Canyon. Searchers didn't find Adams' body for over a month.
'A life saver'
The difference was Adams' lack of an avalanche beacon, which issues a transmission that allows rescuers to pinpoint where a person in buried in the powder.
In Dejong's case, his beacon saved his life, police and rescuers said.
""It's a life saver,"" Malan said. ""I won't go up without one.""
Of course, a beacon does not give people a license to cheat death.
Eastman, the Salt Lake man killed Friday, was also wearing a beacon, but rescuers couldn't revive him despite using CPR.
Avalanche forecasters stressed that much of the new snow that blanketed the Wasatch Front mountains last week had not meshed with old snow, creating a great slide danger. Compounding the problem were sunshine and high temperatures, making the snow even less stable.
""That snow had not bonded underneath. Boy, there are avalanches all along those hills,"" Malan said. ""There were at least six or seven in the next four bowls over. It's really bad up there right now. I told everyone I've seen going up there not to go.""
Tremper said avalanche forecasters did allow an avalanche warning to expire Saturday morning, but he said conditions, with high temperatures and new snow, remain perilous.

Luckily, all of the other snowboarders were off to the side at the time. No one in the party carried any beacons although they did have several shovels with them for building jumps.

Finally, on January 31st, the inevitable happened—the first fatality occurred on that fateful layer.

The death of Brian Roust shook the avalanche community to its core because Brian was not only a fellow avalanche worker, but he was very experienced and cagy. Yes, Brian fit the description of the typical avalanche victim as he was male in his late 20’s and was very skilled in his sport. But he did not fit the profile in that he was a very experienced avalanche worker who had patrolled at Park City and was a route leader at the Canyons Resort at the time of the accident. Not many avalanche professionals die in avalanches.

Brian was skiing in one of his favorite backcountry areas on the Thousand Peaks Ranch, which is private land in the western Uinta Mountains in the Weber River drainage east of Oakley. At least three different parties were skiing in the area and one party of four had skied in the area the day before. As the party of four skied one bowl, Brian and his partner skied an adjacent bowl with his two dogs. The party in the other bowl triggered a large avalanche some distance away from their ski track but no one was caught. Brian and his partner saw this avalanche occur and were on their way back up to the top to regroup with others and talk about the situation.

Brian, a notoriously fit backcountry skier, was out ahead of his partner as they climbed. When Brian neared the top of the slope, he triggered the avalanche that killed him. We do not know yet whether he was going up or down when he triggered the avalanche. The avalanche carried Brian and his dog down the slope and buried them.

Brian’s partner and members of the other party searched the debris with avalanche rescue beacons. The first beacon they found was loose in the snow and not attached to anything—which was a beacon that Brian had attached to his dog and the avalanche had apparently stripped off. The searchers found Brian when they located the second beacon, buried 4 feet deep and he was apparently dead from the trauma of hitting trees on the way down.

We do not know whether Brian called the avalanche report before heading out, although the Uinta Mountains are outside our forecast area. On that day, Tom Kimbrough’s forecast prophetically called the conditions “tricky and dangerous” and that the avalanches “break unexpectedly above you and wider than usual.”

On the same day, an experienced ski patroller triggered an avalanche in the backcountry of Cardiff fork, and rode the avalanche about 1000 vertical feet.","","","","","",""

Stairs Gulch is a very steep and very large avalanche path (5,000 vertical feet) near the bottom of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Few people venture into Stairs Gulch during the winter but sometimes climbers like to test their snow skills there in spring. As the pair ascended in the early morning darkness a large glide avalanche released high above them and descended into the narrow gully they were ascending. When they failed to show up by their scheduled noon return time, searchers found the boot of one victim sticking out of the snow and a search dog located the second victim about four hundred yards above the first victim and he was buried about 8 feet deep.

This is the first known fatality from a glide avalanche in Utah and perhaps the only one in the U.S. Glide avalanches occur when wet snow slides slowly on the ground, similar to a glacier, often for several days, until they randomly release.","","","","","",""

Thick layers of faceted snow are quite common and the range is receiving increasing use from snowmobilers. The accident followed a common pattern. A high- marking snowmobiler became stuck and his two friends went up to help him. The weight of the three people and machines released a large hard slab avalanche running on faceted snow near the ground. One of the three was only partly buried and the sleds were on the surface.

Thanks to Kevin Kobe for letting us copy a few of his great slides......  And Mike Van Horn for the rough black and whites and documentation of the event....","","","The event was written up in ""The Snowy Torrents,"" a classic chronicle of US Avalanche Accidents between 1980 and 1986, by Logan and Atkins.  (86-13)
Logan Canyon Utah, 1 Very Large Avalanche
Weather Conditions:    Strong winds and wet, heavy snows and frequent rains continued to blast the wasatch Mountains of northern Utah.  Since February 11, Wasatch ski areas reported over 40 inches of snow and more than 5.0 inches of water equivalent.  A thick blanket of heavy snows covered a weak snowpack along the steep mountains of Logan Canyon.
Avalanche Data:     Sometime on February 20, a massive avalanche released from the steep eastern face of the ridge between Beirdneau Peak and Mt. Elmer.  Over one million cubic yards of snow raced down the narrow drainage of Wood Camp Hollow--about 13 miles east of Logan--tearing out trees and boulders. The avalanche was classified as an SS-N-5: it released from about 8,600 feet and fell 3,100 vertical feet as it raced 2.5 miles down the drainage.  At its widest spot in the starting zone, the slide was over 1 mile across.  In the valley runout zone debris was piled over 60 feet deep.
Comments:   Though this was not an avalanche accident it is certainly a noteworthy avalanche event.  The avalanche debris in the summer of 1986 looked much like a glacier.  The last of the debris did not melt away until the summer of 1987.
         Large and long-running avalanches are not unfamiliar to the Beirdneau Peak area of Logan Canyon.  In January 1971, several drainages to the southwest of Wood Camp Hollow, two large avalanches ran more than one mile, both damaged and destroyed several houses and structures.   Though no structures were damaged in the February 20 event, these long-running avalanches should serve as a reminder to developers and builders.  Peranent structures built in avalanche paths eventually get struck....

The most notable was the slide in the skiers right side of the prominent slide path ""the other runs"" which failed from the top of slope. Sliding on what looked to be close to the ground as rocks and shrubs were still visible. We could not investigate the crown or bed surface as new snow and wind loading had already began to reload the slope. This run was in our groups closed run list so a proper investigation was not warranted.  The second most notable slide was roughly 60' down slope in the wide spaced trees east of The Other Runs main slide path. This looked to be a step down with roughly a three foot crown. Probe pole depths of the remaining fracture material were 185cm-225cm deep.  Our group initially noticed a small hole close to the tree line on the ridge and as we looked closer we traced the fracture running east. Many blocks of  multiple fractures remian on the ridge and are much farther back in the root of the cornice than expected and snow bridging has already begun.

 

Note: this ridge line should be traveled with cation as new cornice has already developed. Collapsing a snow bridge above an existing fracture could result in a leg injury. This ridgeline is best traveled with a probe to identify that you are not on the leeward (wind loaded) area of the ridgeline.
